At the Grassroots Use of Technology Conference / National Writers Union Digital Media Conference I got to hear a lot of people bemoan how hard it is to make a buck as a creator in the digital age.

A comparison was made to the Open Source Software movement and I made a very quotable statement ( [by Twitter standards](http://twitter.com/SeerGenius/statuses/4931348990)): "Journalism is the software upon which democracy runs".

Other than the awful mixed metaphors, I think I made a good statement: coding software has a very clear correlation between the work itself and the measurement of the final product at the end. Journalism: not so much. Of course some people _do_ talk about how access to information and analysis from diverse viewpoints is vital to the continued health of our Democracy, but they [get shouted down by Glen Beck](http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/media_literacy/bias/glenn_beck_attacks_local_media2139). Newspapers themselves (or Cable Access TV or whatever is going town the toilet today) are usually discussed as some impalpable, circularly-reasoned necessity rather than put into context as _providers of a what __is necessary for the kind of society we want to live in._

Call me progressive, but let's talk about what we need to build tomorrow, not reinforce today.

Here's a quote I [have trouble disagreeing with](http://www.island94.org/2009/08/from-self-actualization-to-neo-liberalism/) from Mark Lloyd's [_Communications Policy is a Civil Rights Issue_](http://www.comtechreview.org/winter-spring-1998/r981lloy.htm):

> ...to argue that getting out of the business of regulation is the only constructive role for government to play is as blind as it is disingenuous. The challenge is to create a set of rules that reflects the best nature of our society. As Newton Minow makes clear in _Abandoned in the Wasteland,_ the issue is not really whether the market provides good choices, but whether citizens have a real say in what those choices are. The issue is whether the parent must let his child be a consumer, or, more to the point, a product to be sold to advertisers, or whether the parent has a right as a citizen to demand more.
