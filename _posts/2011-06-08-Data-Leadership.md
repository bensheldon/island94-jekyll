> "I think the real thing that's going to change is that we're going to start understanding that visualization isn't this sort of monolithic thing... I like to look at it a lot like writing. You have novels and poetry and haikus. You know there's lots of different types of writing and styles of writing â€” and I think the same thing happens in visualization... some things are tools for analysis and some things are purely for entertainment, and there's not so much a spectrum that there is different ways of addressing it." Ben Fry, co-creator of Processing and head of Fathom Design, talking to [O'Reilly Radar](http://fathom.info/latest/581) via [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/2011/05/13/ben-fry-on-visualization-future-and-data-literacy/)
