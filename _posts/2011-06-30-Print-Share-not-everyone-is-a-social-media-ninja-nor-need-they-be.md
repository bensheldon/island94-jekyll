Today is the deadline for DonorsChoose's [Hacking Education Contest](http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education), and fortunately I have completed and submittedÂ  [Print and Share](http://printandshare.org) (with no small effort by [Billy](http://b.illbrown.com) on the design). I previously wrote about the [details](http://www.island94.org/2011/06/data-driven-content-first-design/).

Billy wrote my favorite part of the front-page copy: "Not everyone is a social media ninja."

There is also a [awkward screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWnwdAc2D2k) by yours truly. "This is a great" indeed.
