Two beautifully worded comments from [Gift Hub on Wage Theft](http://www.gifthub.org/2009/11/take-action-against-wage-theft.html#comments): the first because of its vulgar revelry; the second for its straightforwardness:

[tm](http://interimtom.blogspot.com/):

> We know and believe because the likes of Reagan and Bush told us that if we religiously shop with the aim of indulging our most frivolous wishes, wealth will trickle down, down, down, fertilizing the subsoil, giving the healthy brown shrubs and tubers a shot at a day in the sun. Our sun.

and [Gerry](http://twitter.com/ddenizen):

> They would have to abandon the mythology that the poor deserve it and recognize that most people would be just fine if they system were just, which it isn't.

>

> Fairness would be a nice start.
