Hench moves past ["but what if superheroes were actually bad?"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSuperman) and into exploring whether one can have superpowers without aligning/performing as a hero (not according to the heroes) and can someone be villaneous without being evil? (open question)

It's delightful in the Becky Chambers'-style of "let's (try) to be our best selves while navigating our differences against a backdrop of adversity". For some moments I felt like I was reading The Phoenix Project to the extent it was describing contemporary professional life ...but then drops in a story of using child abuse as a supervisory tactic and that was not enjoyable.
