# 2022 in review

- Family: My mom passed away; first parent to go. Of a plus, we spent a lot of time with my brother and his young family.
- Community: Turned 40 this year; celebrated 11 years in SF; coming up on 3 years on Nob Hill. Things feel good. We were approved as a foster/adopt Resource Family, but with everything that happened with my mom, we haven't yet begun hosting children yet. I'm going into year three of strategic planning committee at St. Francis. 
- Work: Started at GitHub after five years at Code for America. Still feels a bit like a dream that I get to continue to do what I want technically (Ruby and Rails) while also working with good people. I've continued to work with my leadership coach, which has been nice continuity. 
- Projects & Consulting: It's now been 10 years since I registered as a small business in SF, which I did when I first started earning money with Day of the Shirt and doing various consulting jobs. GoodJob is floating along, and become a small source of GitHub Sponsors funds. The other constellation of projects continued in maintenance: Brompt, Panlexicon, etc.
