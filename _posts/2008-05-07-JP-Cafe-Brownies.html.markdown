.!.

The cafe down the corner from my house makes the best brownies and I've been wanting this recipe ever since they opened. My friends have been quietly debating whether it was corn syrup or condensed milk that makes them so good. I made an oft-hand remark about it today and the counter-girl went back and wrote out the recipe for me. Turns out the answer is butter and eggs, lots of 'em.

In regard to the amounts below: they were given to me in grams, and I did some loose conversions since I don't have a scale.

3-1/3 C (760g) Butter
1-2/3 Lb (910g) Chocolate
12 Eggs
2 Tsp Vanilla
2-1/2 C (560g) Sugar
3-1/3 C (420g) Flour
2 Tsp Salt

18" X 24" Pan (makes 24 Brownies)

I didn't get the instructions for actually baking them, but I assume that you melt and cool the chocolate, then cream everything, adding the flour at the end.

Probably bake at 350 (though maybe a cooler 325). They should have a torte-like consistency when done---cakily aerated but moist and fudgy if compressed.
