From a Facebook comment on Kate Barr's " [Nonprofits, Social Enterprise, and Hot Buttons](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=476792537759)" ( [blog link](http://www.nonprofitsassistancefund.org/blog/2010/11/30/nonprofits-social-enterprise-and-hot-buttons/)):

> The craving to undermine nonprofit signficance, value and tax-exemption is endless and will probably never be "satisified" until the entire 501-c section of the tax code is repealed. And there do exist those who want to do exactly that. Those who deeply resent paying taxes at all loathe the nonprofit field for its tax exemption. They won't stop and they won't shut up, even when repeatedly, humiliatingly and thoroughly refuted.

This is a perspective I share, though rarely so explicitly.
