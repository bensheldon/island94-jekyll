I could care less about the politics, but it's interesting to see that a congresswoman was [caught ](http://www.dccc.org/stakeholder/archives/005317.html)"plagiarizing" ("borrowing" or "incorporating" if you want to play the pronoun game) in a newspaper column via "a program that monitors high school and college student papers for acts of copying and forgery". (via [ThinkProgress.org](http://thinkprogress.org/2007/09/07/schmidt-caught-plagiarizing-in-newspaper-column/))

I didn't realize that people were using things like [Turn It In](http://turnitin.com/) for non-schoolwork.

Not that I'd want to cite Johnny 10th Grader, but I wonder if their algorithm/database would work for looking for references (which then you could \*properly\* cite).
