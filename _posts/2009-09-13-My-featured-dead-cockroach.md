A [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensheldon/1306195094/) I took in the halls of UMass Boston was featured in a _Wired Magazine _(well, on the website) in " [Universal ‘Death Stench’ Repels Bugs of All Types](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/09/deathstench/)".

> _Image: [Flickr/bensheldon](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensheldon/1306195094/). Note: This photo was chosen from a disturbingly [large volume](http://www.flickr.com/search/show/?q=dead+cockroach) of dead cockroach images on Flickr._

There is a tiny bit of controversy though: I was made aware the photo was being used when a [good samaritan](http://www.tomtwigg.com/) emailed the author saying _Wired_ had not respected the Creative Commons Attribution--**Non-Commercial**

--Share-Alike license under which the image had been posted to Flickr. We're currently awaiting a response from the article's editor.
