In my role as Engineering Manager, I frequently play Keeper of the Process. Having worked effectively alongside plenty of agile `#noplanning` people (RIP Andrew), as well carrying the scars of dysfunctional processes (PRDs are the worst), it feels historically out of character to bug people about OKR scores and target dates. And I think I’ve made my peace with it.  When I was in high school, my friend’s dad Gary (RIP Gary) retired and bought a championship pool table. The pool table went in their living room and left little room for anything else but the stereo, which Gary kept tuned to classic jazz. I played a lot of pool in high school, and listened to a lot of Coltrane and Mingus.   The two games I remember playing most was playing 2-ball “English”, and 9-ball.  English is a “called” game; you have to say which ball and hole you’re aiming for before making the shot. 9-ball is played slop, as long as you hit the lowest-ordered ball first, it doesn’t matter which ball goes into which hole.   Playing English I got really good at fine ball handling and putting a sidespin on the ball (that’s the “English”) and having a narrow intent.  With 9-ball, I learned to do a lot of what we call a “textbook”-shot (I dunno why we gave only this one shot that name, we were 17). The shot was to bounce the ball off of alternating rails as many times as possible until it eventually walked itself into a pocket. Just slam it really.  The point is, both of them were ok ways to play. They were just different. It’s fine.
