Exploring the recesses of my email I came across some bad ideas I gave to a good friend, neighbor and excellent "Social Media Community Architect and Manager" as we were exploring possible resume headers for him:

> If I were to take the best amalgamation of words, I would go with "Social Media Community Architect and Manager"---which is somewhat awkward. I think you want the words:
>
> 1. social (which is the buzzword of online social networking);
>
> 2. community (which is both online and offline and has a certain fuzziness to it); and
>
> 3. something that describes the process of creation... and management.
>
> I would shy clear of the word technology... "media" definitely has more hotness right now. Maybe "Social Media and Community Architect".
>
> What about "Social Media and Community Entrepreneur" (everyone loves an Entrepreneur and I would say you qualify more than anyone I know... though it is somewhat heartless)
>
> I went through my contacts on LinkedIn and picked out some words/phrases they use to describe themselves:
>
> - Community Technologist
> - Online Community Manager
> - strategic planning for your online social network initiatives
> - Building and Executing Social Media Business Strategy
> - Rich Media Developer
> - Interactive Marketing Executive
> - Technology Coordinator
> - Community Architect
> - community & communications coordinator
> - New Media
> - hybrid social media
> - collaboration technology
> - listening technology
> - Emerging
> - Link Development
> - Interactive

I think he went with something sensible like "Community Alchemist".
