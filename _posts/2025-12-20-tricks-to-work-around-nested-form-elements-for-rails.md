I [recently migrated](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/pull/1658) GoodJob’s Dashboard from Rails UJS (“Unobtrusive Javascript”) to Turbo. One of the most significant changes _for me_ of moving from UJS to Turbo is that UJS’s `data-method` is not functionally replaceable with Turbo’s `data-turbo-method`. This `-method` attribute allows you to make a button or link act like a form submission without using a`<form>` element.

I learned some stuff, but first let’s back up even further

### HTML `<forms>` are hard

There’s three practical things, and one conceptual, that are going to challenge us here

**You cannot nest a `<form>` element within another `<form>` element.** When rendering the page, the browser will remove it, or ignore it; regardless it won’t work. Doubly annoying because Chrome’s DevTools will simply remove the element; you have to use `view-source` to witness your mistake.

Some designs would really benefit from a form nested in another form. For example: You have a screen with a bunch of inputs to update a record, and you want to put a “Destroy” button visually adjacent to the “Update” button. Or, for example: you are displaying a list of records that is wrapped entirely in one big form element so that each item can be checked/unchecked to apply actions upon multiple records _and_ you want to be able to have buttons to perform actions on records individually in the list too. Remember, you always want to put destructive or mutating actions behind a POST button rather than a GET link. It can be tricky. Here’s an example of a design challenge in the GoodJob Dashboard:

**HTML forms only support two HTTP methods: `GET` and `POST`.** All the other one’s (`PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` ) are valid _HTTP_ methods, but you can’t use them in an _HTML_ form. Rails works around this with its form helpers by adding a hidden input named `_method` that puts the unsupported method in the formdata, or using Javascript `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`.

**You need a CSRF token.** The form payload must contain the CSRF token payload, which Rails form helpers include as a hidden form element. If the payload doesn’t have a CSRF token, Rails will reject it. THe CSRF token really is important, please don’t disable it. Maybe that’ll [go away someday](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/56350), but not today

Conceptually, I want to leave you with this: **Despite Ruby on Rails being a very good monolithic framework, we must clearly distinguish the HTML Documents and HTTP payloads from the Ruby bits and helpers.**. In this case, we’ll be focusing more on:

- The actual HTML document that the browser will render… over the ERB and Ruby Helpers that can make it easier to author that document.
- The precise HTTP request and form-data payload that a form or javascript produces to send back to the server… over the Form Helpers and superficial Turbo interface.
- How that HTTP request and form-data payload is processed by the Rails and Rack-middleware stack… over the pretty little Ruby hashes and objects you’ll access inside your Controller Actions.

The intent here is not to throw shade at Ruby on Rails. I want to break through what I have sometimes seen from developers who treat Rails like a native app SDK that paints UI on their screen and tightly responds to user input though OS interrupts or something. I want to elevate the HTML Document and HTTP requests that are buzzing back and forth and the limitations _and opportunities_ therein.

### Throw out your UJS `data-method`

As I mentioned in the intro, migrating from UJS to Turbo has some changes. In UJS, the simplest thing to do was use `data-method` and `data-params` for anything extra:

```
<a href="/posts/draft" data-method="put" data-params="something=extra" class="button">Set Draft</a>
```

…and that would generate a form-like HTTP request with all the bits: the `_method` , your CSRF token, and the extra data attributes:

```
POST /posts/draft
_method=put
authenticity_token=alsdkfjasldkjfasdljkf
something=extra
```

But seems like Turbo is [giving](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails/issues/259) [up](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo/issues/915) on `data-turbo-method` , and Turbo never implemented a `data-params` equivalent. So we have to do something different.

### Alternatives for your consideration

Depending on what you need to change about the payload, you have some options:

If you only want to know if someone clicked Button B instead of Button A, then use a different `commit` value for the button; `commit` is just the arbitrary name the Rails framework chose to put in the form-data:

```ruby
<%= form_with model: @post do |f| %>
  <%= f.button "Publish", name: "commit", value: "publish" %>
  <%= f.button "Save Draft", name: "commit", value: "draft" %>
<% end %>
```

…and then do your controller logic based on the `params[:commit]` value. Buttons can have any single `name` and `value` and it goes into the form-data.

We can overload this if we _only_ need to change the method. E.g. if we want to have our Delete button alongside, we can use our knowledge of the magic `_method` overloading to set the method to be treated like a `DELETE`.

```ruby
<%= form_with model: @post do |f| %>
  <%= f.button "Update" %>
  <%= f.button "Delete", name: "_method", value: "delete" %>
<% end %>
```

This produces an HTTP payload that looks like what we want, though it includes all the other form inputs:

```
POST /posts/42
_method=put
authenticity_token=alsdkfjasldkjfasdljkf
title=What was in the form
body=Anything else in the form
_method=delete
```

This works perfectly fine because the Form URL for both the `update` and `destroy` actions are the same, and it’s only the `_method` method that’s different and who cares about some extra form-data we won’t use.

**But what about the duplicate `_method` keys?** [Rails \(or maybe Rack\)](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/53471). when it comes to duplicate keys, will expose only the last value in the params hash. It’s only if you named the key with square brackets like `foo[]` does it become an array of values. This isn’t HTTP, but rather a convention of Rails/Rack for parsing form-data into Ruby data objects.

If we want a different URL, we can use [HTML’s `formaction=` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/button#formaction) to change where the Form is posted:

`<%= f.button "Fancy Delete", name: "_method", value: "delete", formaction: fancy_post_path(@post) %>`

…which leads to HTML that looks like:

```
<form action="/posts/42">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put">

  <button>Save</button> <!-- the regular form button -->
  <button name="_method" value="delete" formaction="/posts/42/fancy">
    Fancy Delete
  </button>
</form>
```

Pretty sweet!

One more tool in our toolbox: In addition to `formaction` which changes the payload target URL, we can [redirect our button to an entirely different form using the `form=` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/form) on the button and targeting the other form by `id`:

```html
<form action="/posts/42" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put">

  <button>Save</button> <!-- the regular form button -->
  <button name="commit" value="delete" form="fancy_delete_form">
    Fancy Delete
  </button>
</form>

<form id="fancy_delete_form" action="/posts/42/fancy" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put">
  <input type="hidden" name="foo" value="bar">
</form>
```

In this case, we can include several more values in our payload in the external form. **The downside here is that the HTTP payload _won’t_ include any of the data from the primary form, only the inputs within the targetted`form=`.**

### Almost but not quite equivalent

We can cover these scenarios:

- Want to change a method or single value or single URL: add some attributes to the button.
- Want to submit multiple different values to a different place: use the `form=` attribute.
- Want to submit both the original form’s data _and multiple other values_…. I don’t know how to do that easily. With UJS you could slot those key-values into `data-params` , but Turbo doesn’t have an equivalent. I encounter this very very rarely. I guess… put them in the query parameters?… Stimulus?
