Diebold (now Premier Election Systems), [admits voting machines have had critical software bug for the last 10 years that can result in votes being lost.](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/us/22brfs-001.html?ref=us)

[Nonsensical comments](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-dupage-elex-aug25,0,7530999.story) from election officials:

> DuPage County election officials were upset to learn their election equipment vendor has acknowledged a programming error that could cause votes not to be tallied, but they said last week that they are confident local elections were not affected.
>
> ...
>
> DuPage has used Premier equipment since 2001. Still, Saar [executive director of the DuPage County Election Commission] said he is confident there were no problems in previous elections.
>
> Saar said DuPage has a rigorous pre-election testing regimen, and its election results are audited by a bipartisan committee.

Where does this confidence stem from? Obviously the pre-election testing and bipartisan committee failed to catch this critical flaw. Not to mention that the lab that certified voting machines was shut down for [not actually doing their job](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/washington/04voting.html?ei=5094&en=363e471aee8b4edc&hp=&ex=1167886800&partner=homepage&pagewanted=all).

The first NY Times article says that they have systems in place to audit and catch inconsistencies. But shouldn't that have set off alarm bells that something in the system was broken?
