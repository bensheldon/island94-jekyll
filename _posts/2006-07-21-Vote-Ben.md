My friend Danielle took this ridiculous photo of me aboard the _Thomas Leighton_ (known locally as the "Tippy Tommy") operating out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. We were at the wedding of a friend taking place on the Piscataqua River, the third fastest-flowing navigable river in the world.

I feel I look very political-worthy in this picture; all I need is to airbrush the tie into an American flag.
