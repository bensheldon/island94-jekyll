I happen to be particularly fond of Puddingstone, the conglomerate rock found around Boston. It's also the official rock of Massachusetts; specifically [Roxbury Puddingstone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxbury_puddingstone).

It's a nifty looking rock, or rather a collection of different rocks within a sedimentary rock.

It also has some fantastical elements:

Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a poem entitled [The Dorchester Giant](http://www.ibiblio.org/eldritch/owh/pudding.html) that describes Boston's puddingstone being the result of the abandoned children of a giant flinging plum pudding about:

> What are those lone ones doing now,
>
> The wife and the children sad?
>
> Oh, they are in a terrible rout,
>
> Screaming, and throwing their pudding about,
>
> Acting as they were mad.
>
> They flung it over to Roxbury hills,
>
> They flung it over the plain,
>
> And all over Milton and Dorchester too
>
> Great lumps of pudding the giants threw;
>
> They tumbled as thick as rain.

Puddingstone is also to be imbued with magical and protective powers. [Herfordshire Puddingstone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_puddingstone) was used to cover the top of witch's coffin to prevent her to escape in death.

**Update: **Here's the whole poem:

> **The Dorchester Giant
>
> By Oliver Wendell Holmes (1830)

**

> There was a giant in time of old,
>
> A mighty one was he;
>
> He had a wife, but she was a scold,
>
> So he kept her shut in his mammoth fold;
>
> And he had children three.
>
> It happened to be an election day,
>
> And the giants were choosing a king;
>
> The people were not democrats then,
>
> They did not talk of the rights of men,
>
> And all that sort of thing.
>
> Then the giant took his children three,
>
> And fastened them in the pen;
>
> The children roared; quoth the giant, "Be still!"
>
> And Dorchester Heights and Milton Hill
>
> Rolled back the sound again.
>
> Then he brought them a pudding stuffed with plums,
>
> As big as the State-House dome;
>
> Quoth he, "There's something for you to eat;
>
> So stop your mouths with your 'lection treat,
>
> And wait till your dad comes home."
>
> So the giant pulled him a chestnut stout,
>
> And whittled the boughs away;
>
> The boys and their mother set up a shout.
>
> Said he, "You're in, and you can't get out,
>
> Bellow as loud as you may."
>
> Off he went, and he growled a tune
>
> As he strode the fields along
>
> 'Tis said a buffalo fainted away,
>
> And fell as cold as a lump of clay,
>
> When he heard the giant's song.
>
> But whether the story's true or not,
>
> It isn't for me to show;
>
> There's many a thing that's twice as queer
>
> In somebody's lectures that we hear,
>
> And those are true, you know.
>
> . . . . . .
>
> What are those lone ones doing now,
>
> The wife and the children sad?
>
> Oh, they are in a terrible rout,
>
> Screaming, and throwing their pudding about,
>
> Acting as they were mad.
>
> They flung it over to Roxbury hills,
>
> They flung it over the plain,
>
> And all over Milton and Dorchester too
>
> Great lumps of pudding the giants threw;
>
> They tumbled as thick as rain.
>
> . . . . .
>
> Giant and mammoth have passed away,
>
> For ages have floated by;
>
> The suet is hard as a marrow-bone,
>
> And every plum is turned to a stone,
>
> But there the puddings lie.
>
> And if, some pleasant afternoon,
>
> You'll ask me out to ride,
>
> The whole of the story I will tell,
>
> And you shall see where the puddings fell,
>
> And pay for the punch beside.
