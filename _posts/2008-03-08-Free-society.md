President W. Bush on his [veto of a CIA waterboarding ban](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030800304.html?hpid=topnews). Of course, the [Operating Manual for Guantanamo Bay Prison](http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure) is on the internet too. But then again, apparently [Guantanamo isn't effective either](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/opinion/19thu1.html).
