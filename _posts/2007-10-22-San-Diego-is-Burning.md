I got an email from my mom this morning that the wildfires in Southern California county were strongly encroaching on my hometown of Poway and the surrounding communities. A couple of my friends started an email list and we've been sending around information about what's happening.

My heart goes out to everyone that's lost something or is worried they may. I hear that both Tabitha's and Liz's dad's, school bus driver and reserve sheriff, respectively, are helping to evacuate people and I'm grateful to them.

For news I've been following the local Public Radio Station KPBS which is doing an [awesome job of keeping up with news and updates.](http://kpbs.digitaria.com/)

(all times are Pacific)

**8:30am** - Tabitha reported that Rancho Bernardo and Espola Road in Poway have been evacuated. They're taking people to the community center off of Poway Rd, and they evacuated West View HS as another safe haven.

**9:30am** - Corinne thinks her families home in Lake Hodges has been lost and Liz reports that someone's house in the same area has been burned.

**10:30am** - Kara's family in North Poway was evacuated at 5am that morning "Just as he was leaving the power went out and he said he could see flames on one of the ridges in the area (not sure which)". This was the same time that Corinne says her folks were evacuated too.

**10:30pm** - Nicole reports that it "sounds like the Poway Community center is overflowing - my grandpa's assisted living facility tried to evacuate their senior citizens there, but couldn't." On the South-East side of Pomerado mountain nicole says "It's nothing like four years ago. No dark black clouds. We're all hoping it will not get worse. No helicopter noise, no fire engine sirens... "

She also includes some pictures:

**12:00noon** - Nicole says "Oye... I think we are evacuating now. things seem to be getting a bit worse, but then again it's hard to tell."

**1:00pm** - Nicole again: "the dogs, my mom, and I are camped out at my dad's work in poway's industrial park. Saw some flames on the Poway grade as we drove over.North Poway is a bit worry some, but looks like south of Twin Peaks is okay."

**2:00pm** - Tabitha reports that her mom was evacuated an hour ago.

**3:00pm** - Liz reports "parts of Bridlewood were on fire so it's really not looking good for my neck of the woods. I hope Old Coach is better"

**4:30pm** - David says that he's been putting out hot spots all afternoon near his house at the end of Twin Peaks (right beneath the Poway Grade, beneath Tooth Mountain).

**5:00pm** - Kara says that her parent's house is gone (along with some neighbors): "When I talked to my mom, she said: 'Well, this solves our problem of selling the house! We can build something smaller and better.'"

**5:00pm** - Adam reports that his parents are staying in a hotel in National City. He also says the international news leaves something to be desired (he's in Australia right now): "CNN won't shut up about Olivia Newton John's home being evacuated, more or less ignoring the 250,000 evacuees in San Diego."

**6:00pm** - Jason reports that a couple houses along Country Day has burned and is worried about Aaron's house.

**7:00pm** - Mandy says that her parents in Upper Windmill have evacuated to Mira Mesa, but that her dad checked a few hours ago and the house is still accessible.

**8:00pm** - Kara sends some pictures she found on [signonsandiego.com](http://signonsandiego.com). "The first one is of the front door (or what was the front door I guess) and the second is from where the office was (you can see the pool....I think the patio furniture is ok! :)"
