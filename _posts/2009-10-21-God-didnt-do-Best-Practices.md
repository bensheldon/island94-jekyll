The best Sunday sermon I have ever heard (out of 2, the other having been when I was 8 and the pastor was my aunt; but that's beside the point) went generally as follows:

The 10 Commandments are unique both in practice, and in form. Of the 10, there are 6 social rules, 3 religious rules, and 1 thoughtcrime (the numbers vary a little depending on dogma, but not by much). Importantly, there are 8 "do not's" but only 2 "do's". God is nearly giving you a free ticket to ride (it was a hip pastor): He didn't spend too much time on the affirmatives; as long as you stay away from those few simple negatives you can do whatever you want (at least in His eyes).

Of course, we have problems even with that, so there's another 60ish books (and counting) to fill in the blanks; but that's beside the point.
