Flipping through _ [The Facilitator's Fieldbook (Second Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Facilitators-Fieldbook-2nd-Tom-Justice/dp/0814473148/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233072760&sr=1-1)_ I really liked their listing/categorization of the different Types of Process Consultation.  It's a straighforward breaking apart of the different methods one might use to facilitate an interaction (_normal-speak translation_: talk to people)

>
1. **Active Listening**: Paying close attention to both what is being said and the processes that are occurring, leading to highlighting clarification, summarizing, and consensus building.
2. **Inquiry**: Questions and probes to raise data, focus attention, and/or stimulate diagnostic thinking; surfacing data for the group to look at.
3. **Observation and feedback**: Seeing what is going on with an individual or the group and then (a) describing in behavioral terms what they are doing; (b) reflecting their emotional state; and (c) interpreting the underling dynamics of what is going on.
4. **Concretization**: Pushing people to be concrete and specific to get beyond generalizations.
5. **Historical reconstruction** : Looking back over events to force a reconstruction and review of what was done and how it was done (emphasizing the process dimensions).
6. **Including process focus**: Building in process analysis periods, feedback sessions, and process discussions.
7. **Cognitive inputs**: Concepts or ideas shared with the group to help members understand something.
8. **Skill building**: Interjecting brief learning activities to enhance the capabilities of the group members in some needed competency (e.g., feedback, problem solving).
9. **Counseling/guidance**: Helping the group or individuals look at themselves and actively engage in solving their own problems
10. **Designing processes**: Designing and managing activities, methods, or exercises to effectively reach desired outcomes.
11. **Structural alternatives**: Suggesting options for group membership, subgroups, interaction patterns, work allocation, roles and responsibilities, and so forth.
12. **Content suggestions or recommendations**: Providing input or opinions concerning the content the group is working on; recommending what the group should do about some aspect of the group's content.

The book also breaks out some other dimensions of your interaction:

| **Non-directive** | **<--->** | **Directive** |
| **Cognitive** | **<--->** | **Emotional** |
| **Reflective**
**(Diagnostic)** | **<--->** | **Active
(Doing)** |
| **Exploratory** | **<--->** | **Confrontative** |
| **Participating
alongside the group** | **<--->** | **Participating in the group** |
