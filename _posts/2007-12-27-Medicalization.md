Interesting article from Ben Goldacre on [homeopathy.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/health/healthmain.html?in_article_id=496612&in_page_id=1774) In regard to medicine in general, he makes this point:

> Prescribing a pill carries its own risks: it medicalises problems, it can promote the idea that a pill is an appropriate response to a social problem such as shyness or difficulties at work.
