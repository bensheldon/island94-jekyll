Tonight I watched the movie musical _How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying_. I was shocked, though not surprised, to discover that all of the office furniture from this 1967 film is the same furniture I have in my office at UMass Boston. The scene above is more representative---the desk and shelving are the same (and I used to have that typewriter stand)---but the orange chair in the scene below is mine.
