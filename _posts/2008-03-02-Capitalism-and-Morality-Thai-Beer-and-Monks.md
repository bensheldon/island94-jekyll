I find myself mentioning [this story](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&sid=afr76o.Ii2GE&refer=asia) a lot; primary because the monks have a very strong conception of capitalism and where it morally breaks down: _if you let this company go public, it will be their legal imperative to increase their value, which will be done by promoting the consumption of their product, which is alcohol_.

And then, the (former) PM's view:

> As the alcohol industry is the cause of many damages to society, as shown by those statistics, it lacks the qualifications to raise funds and list in the stock exchange. Even if, from an economic point of view, it is the source of tax collected from the sale of beer, it's not worth all the losses it creates.
