This is a quick roundup of what's new with GoodJob since the last update published for [GoodJob v1.4](https://island94.org/2021/01/goodjob-1-4-jruby-compatibility-and-more). 

GoodJob ([github](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job)) is a multithreaded, Postgres-based, ActiveJob backend for Ruby on Rails. If you’re new to GoodJob, read the  [introductory blog post](https://island94.org/2020/07/introducing-goodjob-1-0) .

_For further details on the following updates, check out GoodJob's [Changelog](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) or [Readme](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/blob/main/README.md)._

### GoodJob v1.5: Web Dashboard and configuration

GoodJob ships with a [web dashboard](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job#dashboard) to display future, finished and errored jobs for easy inspection.  The Dashboard mounts as a self-contained Rails Engine.

GoodJob uses more `Rails.application.config...` for improved autoloading compatibility; deprecation notices have examples for updating configuration.

### GoodJob v1.6: Daemonize

GoodJob can run as a backgrounded daemon for folks who are still managing servers with `--daemonize`.

### GoodJob v1.7: Scheduled job cache

GoodJob caches scheduled jobs (i.e. `ExampleJob.set(wait: 30.minutes).perform_later`) for signifiantly improved latency without relying upon polling. 

### GoodJob v1.8: Graceful shutdown

GoodJob added additional shutdown options, including `GOOD_JOB_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` to allow jobs to finish before exiting.

### GoodJob v1.9: async_server mode

GoodJob added an additional `async` execution mode to simplify the default configuration: running jobs as part of the web-process (and _not_ console, Rake commands, etc.)

### Upcoming: cron and concurrency controls

GoodJob will add support for cron-style repeating jobs, and concurrency controls to ensure that only a specified number (1 or more) jobs are enqueued or performed at the same time.  I previously was opposed to extending ActiveJob's interface, but [have changed my mind](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/issues/255); it's on!
