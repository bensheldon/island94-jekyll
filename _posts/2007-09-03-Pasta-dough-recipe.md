1 cup flour (I've been using white whole wheat)

1 egg

~2tbps cool water

1. Mix flour and egg, adding water until flour is just moistened and sticks together

2. Let rest for 5 minutes

3. Knead the dough for 2 minutes. Or you can do it for 10 minutes; more kneading means better developed gluten and a "smoother" noodle.

4. Let rest 10 minutes

5. Roll out or whatever
