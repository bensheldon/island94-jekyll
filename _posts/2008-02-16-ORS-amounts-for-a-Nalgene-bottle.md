For a 32oz Nalgene Bottle (the standard biggish one) of clean water, the Oral Rehydration Salt quantities are:

- Slightly less than 1/2 teaspoon of Salt (0.43tsp. to be exact)

- 7.5 teaspoons of Sugar

(Personal note: when you've made it correctly, it should taste like minusculey-sweet saliva)

Adapted from [Rehydrate.org's ORS Recipe](http://www.rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm#recipes) based on 1 liter of water.

And the wikipedia entry on [Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_salt)
