A cable access TV producer is indicted on child pornography charges. The station pulls their show saying "it's good sense". An uninvolved station [gives their point of view](http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091030/NEWS02/910300312):

> Sylvia McDaniel, executive director of Portland Community Media, which operates under the state government, said she cannot suspend a show unless lawbreaking occurs in the studio or within the context of the show.
>
> "We manage the programs, not people's personal lives," McDaniel said, in a phone interview.
>
> "We also go by their behavior in our facility," she added. "Producing the show 'Cannabis Common Sense' doesn't give them the right to stand in my parking lot and smoke dope."
>
> "My jurisdiction is what goes on my channels, not what someone does outside my jurisdiction," McDaniel added. "Their personal lives are none of my business. I don't pull a show if it has nothing to do with the show."

I also appreciate how the article's author contextualizes this quote from the station that pulled the show:

> RVTV in general "allows free speech," but, she said, it's run by a public university in a small town and is "a lot more conservative in approach."

In general, if you have to qualify speech, it isn't free, but that's just my opinion.
