I'm still parsing through H.R.1363, the $38 billion appropriations bill passed late last night, but [this is generally representative](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h1363/text?version=eh&nid=t0:eh:361) of the sausage trading to pay Paul approach:

> Sec. 8079. In addition to the amounts appropriated or otherwise made available elsewhere in this Act, $65,200,000 is hereby appropriated to the Department of Defense: _Provided_, That upon the determination of the Secretary of Defense that it shall serve the national interest, he shall make grants in the amounts specified as follows: $20,000,000 to the United Service Organizations; $24,000,000 to the Red Cross; $1,200,000 to the Special Olympics; and $20,000,000 to the Youth Mentoring Grants Program: _Provided further_, That funds available in this section for the Youth Mentoring Grants Program may be available for transfer to the Department of Justice Youth Mentoring Grants Program.
