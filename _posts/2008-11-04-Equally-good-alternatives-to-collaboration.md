Yesterday I posted an article that sought to give a broader frame to the idea of [cross-sector nonprofit collaboration](http://island94.org/articles/how-create-cross-sector-nonprofit-value): placing collaboration within a process of negotiation to create new value. Today I will break down negotiation a little bit further to show why I think it's important to take a broader frame of things and maybe even [get semantic](http://island94.org/articles/how-create-cross-sector-nonprofit-value#comment-3761). **Updated to add:** :-)

When I'm talking about negotiation, I'm really talking about one particular piece of community engagement. Community engagement is all about self-evaluation (what can we offer the community?), communications/outreach (sending _and_ receiving), and creating opportunities for participation---leadership, governance, programming and volunteerism all included. Negotiation is the piece where you are actively communicating with specific members of the community: individuals, groups, organizations, businesses and government.

So if collaboration is just one option within negotiation, what are the others? To that I really like the Thomas-Kilman Conflict Management Model:

![](http://island94.org/files/island94.org/Thomas-Kilman Conflict Management Model.png "Thomas-Kilman Conflict Management Model")

**Assertiveness** (Y-Axis) is the extent to which you attempt to satisfy your own concerns, values, or interests.

**Cooperativeness** (X-Axis) is the extent to which you attempt to satisfy their conncerns, values or interests.

It's designed specifically for individual conflict management situations, but I think it really helps to illuminate the different ways you can interact with another party that intentionally produces an outcome.

What I like about the instrument is that it's non-judgemental; none of the strategies are intrinsically _the best_; instead the best is the one that is most effective or appropriate in the situation at hand. Not every situation can be collaborative because of limited time, resources, or [competing values and interests](http://island94.org/articles/nonprofit-competition-concept-map).

Understanding the different approaches you can take to---as I said yesterday---create value, is important and provides a broader framework with which you can understand your organization's place in the community, and act to positively and iteratively transform its actions.
