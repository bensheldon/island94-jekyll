Dandy's recipe:

- 8 medium tomatoes, stewed
- 1 jalapeno
- 4 green onion, chopped
- 1/4 bunch of cilantro, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves


Then:

- In large sauce pan, stew tomatoes and jalepeno.
- Remove stem from jalapeno.
- Put into blender or food processor.
- Add garlic.

Then:

- Pour into pan.
- Add 4 green onions and cilantro.
- Simmer for 15 minutes.
- Salt and pepper to taste.

_My alteration_:

Take all of the above ingredients, and just throw them in a blender (I use a can of whole stewed tomatoes rather than the fresh tomatoes---probably better fresh). Done._
