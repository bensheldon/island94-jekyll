Boston's _Metro_ newspaper ran a [page 2 article](http://www.metro.us/boston/local/article/712124--bike-map-offers-crash-warnings) on the [Boston Bike Crash Map](http://bostoncyclistsunion.org/resources/crash-map/) the Boston Cyclists Union and I [created](http://www.island94.org/2010/11/boston-bike-crash-map/). Also in the news:
