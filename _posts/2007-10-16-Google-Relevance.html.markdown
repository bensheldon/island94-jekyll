On Slashdot today was an [entry](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/16/135209) about [Google Search if it was designed for Google](http://www.meangene.com/google/design_for_google.html). Basically redesigning the page for a higher pagerank.

Fun, but the interesting thing was a [comment](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=329457&cid=20998511) from the comments:

>

> Should read: What if Google was a useless site...

> ...and had to design for Google?

> Lets see... counter examples... how about searching Google for the word "shipping". What do you know, UPS and Fedex are #1 and #2, and their front pages aren't a mess of useless, Google-pleasing crap. Maybe because they are real businesses and aren't pandering some direct ship junk or get rich quick scheme.

Makes sense, and is the basis for what I tell people who are concerned about SEO disproportionately to having a useful and relevant website: concentrate on having a good service and a useful website first.
