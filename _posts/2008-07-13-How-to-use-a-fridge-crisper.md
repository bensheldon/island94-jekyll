After a bunch of googling around, I haven't found an authoritative answer to my question: how are you supposed to set up and use your refrigerator's food crisper---fruits and vegatables need different levels of humidity (which ones need what I wasn't sure), and the little baffles are supposed to change that (which setting does what I wasn't sure).

So it seems that they are more about humidity than they are about keeping your foods fresh.

That being said, this [Cooks Illustrated PDF](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=6&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cooksillustrated.com%2Fimages%2Fdocument%2Fhowto%2FMA01_ILRefrigerator.pdf&ei=ucB6SOK_Mo-sedzm0BM&usg=AFQjCNHC4Mj96IEr34myeqlfYqRnYRVSNg&sig2=82wwUpKvN85GZZ6emhy1lg) seemed to give a half-way decent explanation of the proper settings and use:

- **Opening the baffles** for air to pass through lowers the humidity, which is fine for basically anything that needs to be kept cold (like some fruit: apples and grapes)

- **Closing the baffles** to stop air from circulating allows the humidity to rise for leafy vegetables.

But according to Cooks Illustrated, it's all much more complicated than that---some produce like it warmer than the crisper may provide, like green beans, subtropical fruits, melons and herbs. So good luck if you have roommates.
