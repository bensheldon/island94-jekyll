If salmonella outbreaks weren't actually killing people the following [statement](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/health/bal-te.salmonella04jul04,0,1339689.story) might be a humorous farce of a murder investigation:

>

> Investigators are seeing more signs that the salmonella outbreak blamed on tomatoes might have been caused by tainted jalapeno peppers.... Echoing federal officials, who said this week that tomatoes remain the prime suspect, the health officials said that tomatoes cannot be ruled out as the cause of the outbreak. Investigators have been collecting samples of another possible suspect, cilantro, though the herb is less likely to be the source, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.

Other possible scenarios: salsa tryst, the tomato has an evil twin, the butler did it.
