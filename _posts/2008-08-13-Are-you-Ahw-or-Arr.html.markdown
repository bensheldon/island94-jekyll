Via some [fun copy](http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/08/12/toastabags-grill-che.html) on BoingBoing Gadgets ("These "Toastabags" (phonemologically Bostonian, apparently...") and someone's [analytical comment](http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/08/12/toastabags-grill-che.html#comment-258382)

, I came across a way to cleave English speakers: those that pronounce R's (rhotic), and those that don't(non-rhotic). From the wikipedia page on [Rhotic and non-rhotic accents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents):

>

> English pronunciation is divided into two main accent groups, the rhotic (pronounced /ˈroʊtɪk/) and non-rhotic, depending on when the sound typically represented in spelling with the letter R is pronounced. Rhotic speakers pronounce written /r/ in all positions, while non-rhotic speakers pronounce /r/ only if it is followed by a vowel sound (see "linking and intrusive R"), and not always even then.
