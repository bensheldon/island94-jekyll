Community technology is great. It is incredibly refreshing to be reminded on a daily basis that, as a developer and technologist, I don't know crap about how everyday people view and use technology. Two weeks ago I was in Washington, DC for the CTCnet Conference. While there I helped John Lorance of [CompuMentor](http://www.compumentor.org/) give a presentation on how Community Technology Centers and nonprofit orgaizations can use "Web 2.0" services and tools like [Flickr](http://flickr.com), [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us), [wikis](http://wikipedia.org), [mapping](http://mappingaccess.com), _et cetera_, to improve their programs and better fulfill their missions. At the end we opened the floor to questions and comments. An attendee stood up and said that he had always been worried that with computers and machines growing ever smarter and more powerful, one day they would overthrow mankind. _But_, after seeing these new Web 2.0 tools, he is relieved that humans will always stay one step ahead of the machines. _Hallelujah_. I made this drawing using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), an awesome open source illustration program.
