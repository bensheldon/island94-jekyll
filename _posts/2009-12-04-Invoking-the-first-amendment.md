The [eloquent wording](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roberto-lovato/bastadobbs-responds-to-in_b_329161.html) of [Roberto Lovato](http://presente.org/), from the (now successful) [Basta Dobbs](http://www.bastadobbs.com/) campaign, to Lou Dobbs:

> You and others have suggested that we are seeking to abridge your free speech. Such arguments exhibit a shallow understanding of what the first amendment protects. You are free to voice your opinions, just as we are free to encourage CNN to cancel your program. There is, quite simply, nothing in the constitution that guarantees you a national news platform from which to spread misinformation, and invoking its protections is only a distraction from the real conversation.
