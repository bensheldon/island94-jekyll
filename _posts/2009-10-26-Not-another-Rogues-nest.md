The following is from the [1824 edition](http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pitttext;cc=pitttext;rgn=full%20text;idno=00aft2763m;didno=00aft2763m;view=image;seq=162;node=00aft2763m%3A16;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; ) of Zadok Cramerâ€™s _The Navigator_ on Island 94:

> **No. 94, Stack or Crow's nest Island, six miles below 93,**
>
> Has been sunk by the earthquake, or swept off by the floods; but just below where it stood is a high sandbar, covered with young willows, and is about the middle of the river. This bar may grow into another Crow's, but it is to be hoped, not into another _Rogue's_ nest. The river here bears hard against the head of the bar, and also against the right hand bank--channel right side near to the island, thence draws toward the right hand shore.
>
> The creek empties in on the right side, just above the two settlements. The Washita heads not far from this place, on which is a considerable settlement, 40 miles distant, and to which from hence is a cut road. It is thirty miles to Moorehouse's settlement on that river.
>
> Crows's nest or Stack island was very small, and stood in about the middle of the Nine Mile reach. A large bar had formed just below where the island stood, but it also has given way to the current, and is no more.
>
> Four miles below this island (No. 94,) is a sandbar in a right hand bend--channel on the left of it.

I love the slant rhyme humor: "This bar may grow into another Crow's but it is to be hoped not into another _Rogue's_ nest." The print is below.
