I am also convinced, but cannot prove, that there are no objects, but only relations.  By this I mean that I am convinced that there is a consistent way of thinking about nature that refers only to interactions between systems and not to states of or changes in individual systems. I am convinced that this way of thinking of nature will end up to be the useful and natural one in physics.
