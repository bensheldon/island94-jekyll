I am very impressed with how Marcus du Sautoy's _The Number Mysteries_ integrates hyperlinks into the book using URL shorteners and QR codes (above). Contrast that with Dan Cederholm's _Handcrafted CSS _(which is still an excellent book)_. _The latter was published August 2009, the former August 2010.
