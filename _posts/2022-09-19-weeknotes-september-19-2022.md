- My mom, Susan, Sue, passed away at her home last Tuesday morning. Her wishes were that people recognize her life through donations to the [Santa Barbara Food Bank](https://donate.foodbanksbc.org/) and [Save the Children](https://support.savethechildren.org/). My brother and I are figuring out everything else; email me at bensheldon@gmail.com if you'd like to stay updated. 
- Having spent the last 5 weeks with my mom, her doctors' ongoing prognoses that she "has days" was incorrect for quite a while until it wasn't. We got to the zoo and the Botanic Gardens together. I enjoyed flustering the hospice nurse over the phone by passing along their questions directly, like "hey mom, how _are_ your bowels?" and the nurse's response of "oh, oh, I didn't realize she was present". To her doctor's surprise the day before she passed, what would be my mom's last meal: taquitos. 
- I learned the stories behind all the butts in my mom's nude paintings. And, though my mom wouldn't have the opportunity out to exercise it, that California has an [End of Life Option](cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/End-of-Life-Option-Act-.aspx). 
- I'm grateful for my family, friends, and colleagues who have been gracious and supportive. Both to those I've told, and those who are yet to find out. Thank you.
