A few years ago, I read the Southern Reach trilogy, by Jeff Van Der Meer....

One of the main concepts of the books is the idea of a terroir, a self-contained natural environment that shapes everything inside of it. Usually when we talk about a terroir we’re referring to wine: a wine from a given region tastes like wine from that given region should taste because of the grapes and the soil and the way the sunlight hits that particular spot. Since I left my last  job, I’ve been thinking a lot about the idea of terroir as it relates to the workplace. 

Every workplace, like every Tolstoyan family,  is unique in its own way.  When we start a job, we enter that terroir with the intent to shape it. But in turn, we are also shaped by it.
