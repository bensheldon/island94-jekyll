**Update: This has been mostly fixed upstream in Rails (Rails 8.0, I think) and [documented in the Rails Guides](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52209).**

_Huge thank you to Vojta Drbohlav in the [Rails Performance Slack](https://www.railsspeed.com/) for helping me figure this out! ðŸ™‡_

Things I learned today about a new-to-me Ruby on Rails feature:

- Rail 7.1 added a feature called ["Strict Locals"](https://blog.kiprosh.com/allow-template-to-set-strict-locals/) that uses a magic comment in ERB templates to declare required and optional local variables. It looks like this: `<%# locals: (shirts:, class: nil) %>` which in this example means when rendering the partial, it must be provided a `shirts` parameter and optional `class` parameter. Having ERB templates act more like callable functions with explicit signatures is a nice feature.
- When using Rails Strict Locals, the `local_assigns` variable [_is not defined_](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4bb73233413f30fd7217bd7f08af44963f5832b1/actionview/lib/action_view/template.rb#L439-L444). You can't use `local_assigns`. You'll see an error that looks like `ActionView::Template::Error (undefined local variable or method 'local_assigns' for an instance of #<Class:0x0000000130536cc8>)`. **This has been [fixed](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52209) ðŸŽ‰ though `local_assigns` doesn't expose default values.**
- This is a problem if your template has locals that are also Ruby reserved keywords like `class` or `if`, which can be accessed with `local_assigns[:class]` _unless you start using Strict Locals_.
To access local variables named with reserved keywords in your ERB template when using Strict Locals, you can use `binding.local_variable_get(:the_variable_name)`, e.g., `binding.local_variable_get(:class)` or `binding.local_variable_get(:if)`. **This is still necessary if you want to access reserved keywords _with defaults_ because the defaults don't show up in `local_assigns`.**
