This is a short video that I shot of my neighbor’s pool. Using my little Casio digicam and a camera mount consisting of a box of Trader Joe’s Green Tea, I taped some of the gusty winds we were getting today as they moved leaves around in the pool.

The original tape was 27 minutes that I then cut frames from (by about a factor of 50) to give a time lapse effect. If you watch the bottom right of the screen you can see the shadows shift as the sun moves overhead. I am not sure, but there is a quick round white reflection that moves across the pool that I think may be the moon.

Enjoy.
