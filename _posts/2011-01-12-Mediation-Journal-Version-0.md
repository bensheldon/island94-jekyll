I [earlier](http://www.island94.org/2010/12/mediation-journal-pieces/) posted a picture from a project I was working on for journaling media usage. Below is the book I got back from POD (I used Lulu and am quite satisfied). I still have a few changes I want to make before I consider it "finalized": increasing the gutter size (the gutter calculator is clearly configured for reading, not writing), optimizing the half-tones and gradients (I printed a test scale in the back of the book), and redoing the cover (I don't think I had the DPI set properly for the only rasterized image I used in the entire project).

Also, after reading this piece by Kelli Anderson on documenting work, I'm trying to take better project and process photos. I took these photos on my porch, in 20° weather---but the natural sunlight made it worth it.
