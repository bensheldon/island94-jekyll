This week's topic in my Critical and Creative Thinking class is stress and stress-relieving exercises. I get a kick out of the table of thought distortions brought on by stress from [_Challenging and changing stress-producing thinking_](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071234/) by Felice E Miller published in the Western Journal of Medicine, 2001 January; 174 (1): 49–50.

"Catastrophizing" also reminds me of old woman in the film [_Underground_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114787/) that continually says "It's a catastrophe!" (or "katastrofa" because it's Serbo-Croatian/BCE)---which my girlfriend and I like to repeat ad naseum.

**Table 1**

Common thought distortions and how to challenge them

|

| **_ Distortion _**

| **_ Challenge _**

|

|

| Magnification or minimization

| Overemphasizing or underemphasizing one aspect of the situation: “I didn't check out with the patient if he understood the reason for the medication”; overlooking other factors that may be important

|

|

| Polarization

| Using black and white thinking: “My colleagues are going to think I am incompetent”; are there shades of gray?

|

|

| Personalization

| Taking the situation personally and ignoring the total picture: “It's my fault”; what would I say to a colleague in the same position?

|

|

| Stress-producing language

| Using words such as should, have to, must, need rather than would like, want: “I should never make a mistake”

|

|

| Pessimistic thinking

| Thinking of the situation as permanent, pervasive, and personal: “I'm never going to have the respect of my colleagues” or “I'm not suited to this profession”; rather than temporary, specific, and related to factors beside myself [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071234/#ref3)

|

|

| Catastrophizing

| Is this unfortunate incident a catastrophe: “I'm going to be sued”; if the bad outcome happened, what would/would not be the consequences, and could I handle them?
