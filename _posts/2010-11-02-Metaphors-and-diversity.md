Interactions between people with diverse backgrounds leads to richer and more effective experiences.

About two months ago I attended the [140 Character Conference in Boston](http://boston2010.140conf.com/schedule). Mostly it was a bunch of white guys using phrases like "filter disintermediation". Fortunately there was a woman who described the need to "midwife" a process, and a crazy old guy (that _is_ what I wrote in my notebook---though he probably made the most sense) who described the educational system as "constipated". They were the highlights---and pretty much all I remember too.
