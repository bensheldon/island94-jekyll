> “We’re placing so many demands on bees we’re forgetting that they’re a living organism and that they have a seasonal life cycle,” Marla Spivak, a honeybee entomologist at the University of Minnesota, told The Chronicle. “We’re wanting them to function as a machine. . . . We’re expecting them to get off the truck and be fine.”

From a [Michael Pollan article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/magazine/16wwln-lede-t.html?pagewanted=1&ref=magazine) in the NY Times Magazine. Sounds very similar to these [criticisms of a mobile workforce](http://island94.org/node/176).
