Fiction writer Dawes Green was on [Studio360 on Saturday night](http://http://www.studio360.org/episodes/2009/08/21) and he made mention of how people have changed since he last published a novel 14 years ago:

> People aren’t reading books so much. They text and Twitter and Google a lot—anxiety reading—but they’re too jumpy for books.

(I slightly lie: that quote above is from a _Publishers Weekly_ interview, via [Literary License blog](http://litlicense.blogspot.com/2009/07/anxiety-reading.html), but it was close enough to what he said on the radio)
