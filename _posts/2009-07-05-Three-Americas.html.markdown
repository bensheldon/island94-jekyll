My friend Thomas posted a status message to Facebook "wonders why Republicans hate America?". This is where I'm at:

> Define your terms! :-) By "America" do you mean?

>

>

1. a pluralist society striving for a more representative government and greater civil liberties

>

2. a consensus society seeking a return to a more stable civic life built upon firm social and ethical principles

>

3. a geo-political demarcation for a group of people equally as unexceptional as everyone else.
