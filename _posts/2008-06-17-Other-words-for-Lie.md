It's another election year which means that politics are flying.

From a story on [NASA forcibly downplaying global warming](http://www.townhall.com/news/sci-tech/2008/06/02/nasas_own_watchdog_agency_misled_on_global_warming):

> The report did not directly accuse them of lying, but used more nuanced terms such as "**mendacity** " and "**dissembling**." The space agency complained those terms were unjust.

And I enjoy how the New York Times [describes a John McCain statement](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/us/politics/17policy.html?pagewanted=2&hp):

> Like Mr. Bush, Mr. McCain has steadfastly refused to set dates for withdrawals of troops and envisions a long-term American presence in the country. But last month, in the general election battleground state of Ohio, Mr. McCain did a **semantic dance** and said he expected that most American troops would be home from Iraq by 2013.
