Minimal comment on [Microsoft entering the retail space](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/02/12/microsoft_to_open_new_retail_stores_like_apple.html) with Apple-_esque_ stores---dumb---but I liked the press release:

>

> We're working hard to transform the PC and Microsoft buying experience at retail by improving **the articulation and demonstration of the Microsoft innovation and value proposition** so that it's clear, simple and straightforward for consumers everywhere."

You do though have to mis-pronounce proposition as _proposation_ to really maintain the flow. That would also help to further increase the irony of the ending clause.
