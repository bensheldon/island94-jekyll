I was having a hard time explaining exactly what Fred Turner means by the conclusion of his book, _From Counterculture to Cyberculture,_ I [wrote about earlier](http://island94.org/close-machine). It really seems difficult to explain things without using informationalist rhetoric.

This makes me think of the [About Wealth Bondage page](http://www.wealthbondage.com/2005/05/the_constructio.html):

> Wealth Bondage is pervasive, the horizon within which postmodern life, in every aspect, appears to us as a Market....
>
> All interpretations of Wealth Bondage are themselves inside Wealth Bondage and as such are provisional, for there is not "outside" of Wealth Bondage.

I'm not entirely sure what the heck that means, but if I were to be all thinky, I could try to connect the idea of Bakhtin's [Dialogic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogism):

> everything anybody ever says always exists in response to things that have been said before and in anticipation of things that will be said in response.

with the idea of [memes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) and suppose that certain rhetorical "memes" (like peer-to-peer informationalism or market exchange) are able to, within the diologic, competitively displace other rhetorical memes.
