I've found the [Lumifi Search / Research Platform](http://lumifi.com) useful at times, but it sometimes seems like a sledgehammer. They have a widget for just search that's pretty useful. If I'm looking for specific things with a lot of noise (like "nonprofit culture"), it tends to give some interesting results.

Get the [lumifi](http://www.widgetbox.com/widget/lumifi) widget and many other [great free widgets](http://www.widgetbox.com/galleryhome/) at [Widgetbox](http://www.widgetbox.com) !

They also have it as an [OSX Dashboard Widget](http://www.lumifi.com/Widget.html).
