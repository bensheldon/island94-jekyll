- During my absence, my team was reorganized and I moved under a new director and from developer experience to the product development organization. It's been exciting (new people, new relationships, new opportunities) and also tiring (new people, new relationships, new opportunities). My team was an odd duck in the old structure, and less-so but still odd in the new structure. My verdict is out if that's an improvement. I think it can be sometimes be easier to stick out hugely instead of subtly: it's called whackamole, not whackagiraffe.
- My team, Ruby Architecture, moved from "Build & Test" within DX, to "UI and Monolith Platform" within Core Productivity. In my old group I was figuring out collaborations with the testing and CI platform. With the new group, we're figuring out how to better explain "platforms" ourselves. I see a lot of "Shifting Left" in my future and I'm here for it.
- "A feeling you don't act upon isn't real." I've picked up this quote from nearly every Kim Stanley Robinson novel I've read. I shared it with a few of my reports this week; I've been (gently, I hope!) pushing people to share feedback more actively outside the team.
- "It's ok to be mad, it's not ok to be mean". Angelina and I had dinner this week with family friends who have a 10-year old and they've been a resource during our foster parenting journey. This phrase came up and I have been thinking about this as a better alternative to "Assume good intent." I'm a big fan of Non-Violent Communication and it fits right in there.
- Performance Review Season is kicking off again. I'm eligible. It feels like no time has passed but this week is my 6 month anniversary at GitHub! It's still fun.
 - With my leadership coach, we've been talking about [Moral Mazes](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/279812.Moral_Mazes), which led to [Meditations on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). The overall theme, and I've now been working with the coach for three (!) years is (my words): taking action authentically. And then exploring different shapes of that.
