Read a fun article about [Breakfast Cereals](http://www.salon.com/mwt/food/eat_drink/2007/10/03/breakfast_cereal/) via a comment on [breakfast cupcakes, err, muffins](http://www.megnut.com/2007/10/are-they-breakfast-cupcakes#comment-3498).

Mostly I like the article because of all the industry definitions:

>
>
> RTEC: Ready to Eat Cereal
>
> inclusions: the industry term for all that extra junk like raisins, marshmallows and honey-coated granola clusters.

and random facts, like this one:

>
>
> a serving of Cheerios has 10 milligrams more sodium than a serving of Doritos.
