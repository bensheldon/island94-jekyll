William Bloom:

> "...people do not work and create the economy because they want to support the economy. They create and relate---and this in turn, creates the economy."

From David Boyle’s _The Little Money Book. _His commentary on the quote above: "So don't be taken in by economists. We created the economy around us, and if we want to change it, we can do just that."
