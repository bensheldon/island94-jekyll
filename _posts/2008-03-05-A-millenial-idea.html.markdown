A New York Times article on [paying kids based on their standardized test scores](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/nyregion/05incentive.html):

> [City of Angels dvd](http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/?city_of_angels) ...a seventh-grade English class was asked one morning if there were too many standardized tests. Every hand in the room shot up to answer with a defiant yes. But at the same time, the students all agreed that receiving money for doing well on a test was a good idea, saying it made school more exciting, and made doing well more socially acceptable.

Sounds an awful lot like the standard beef with millenials: entitlement and "everyone gets a trophy". Of course, 7th graders are too young to be millenials, so maybe millenials are already in school administrative positions. The eldest (born 1981) would be 27.
