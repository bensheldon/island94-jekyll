[Biblical news](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6274502/God-is-not-the-Creator-claims-academic.html) from Academia:

> Professor Ellen van Wolde, a respected Old Testament scholar and author, claims the first sentence of Genesis "in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth" is not a true translation of the Hebrew. ...
>
> She said she eventually concluded the Hebrew verb "bara", which is used in the first sentence of the book of Genesis, does not mean "to create" but to "spatially separate".
>
> The first sentence should now read "in the beginning God separated the Heaven and the Earth" ...
>
> She writes in her thesis that the new translation fits in with ancient texts.
>
> According to them there used to be an enormous body of water in which monsters were living, covered in darkness, she said. ...
>
> She concluded that God did not create, he separated: the Earth from the Heaven, the land from the sea, the sea monsters from the birds and the swarming at the ground.

That doesn't make for great dogma, but it fits in with my thoughts on consciousness: it's the continual process of creating meaning by separating _something_ from the nothing at the corners of our consciousness (not to mention beyond it) that is the world around us. The fun of consciousness is taking control of that process of separation---which is why I spent so much time rewriting that last sentence.
