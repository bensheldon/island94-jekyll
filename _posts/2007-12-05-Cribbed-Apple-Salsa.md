One of my favorite haunts in Boston is Delux in the South End---mostly because a successive series of my friends have worked there.

One of their best dishes is the Quesadillas, which are made so in part by the fruit salsa. I've been working to deconstruct it, so this is what I think is in it:

(this isn't proportional)

- Apple (seems like something red, maybe a macintosh)
- Red Pepper
- Yellow Pepper
- Red onion
- Yellow Onion (maybe)
- Jalapeno
- Pineapple juice (like a tiny splash, maybe)

It's all chopped up into maybe 1/4 chunks and amazing
