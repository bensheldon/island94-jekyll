My office bookshelf fell off the wall today; to lighten the load I decided to read something on it: working in an environment of higher education, I pickup a lot of junk books:

Above is Janet's Spiral Periodic Table from E.G. Mazur's _Graphic Representations of the Periodic System during One Hundred Years_

- [голова болит секс](http://nerealp.co.cc/121.html)

(1974), cited in Punyashloke Mishra's_ The Role of Abstraction in Scientific Illustration: Implications for Pedagogy_ (1999) republished in Carolyn Handa's _Visual Rhetoric in a Digital World: A Critical Sourcebook_. Got all that?

I had to scan Janet's Spiral out of the book since I couldn't find it on the internet. I did find Alexander Roy's patented and $14.95 [Desktopper](http://allperiodictables.com/aptpages/apt_1_OrderPageAAE.html). He seems to [tout](http://allperiodictables.com/ClientPages/AAEpages/aaeADI.html) it as originally his, but it's trivially Janet's Spiral Periodic table if you stuck your finger into each spiral and pulled up.

_**Update: **_

_ Having just printed off and built the paper template included in the patent application, I must admit the design is a unique and  innovative._

Below is from the [patent](http://www.google.com/patents?id=ynliAAAAEBAJ&zoom=4&dq=%233581409&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=%233581409&f=false):
