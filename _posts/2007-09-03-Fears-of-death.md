[Thoughts of mortality](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/31/how-voters-are-susce.html) make people entrench their beliefs. (via boingboing). It also makes people act in ways that boost their self-esteem, which, importantly, affects their [consumer behavior](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/mktg_shiv_mortality.shtml) (via google).

These seem to both be domestic studies. I wonder how the US compares internationally in "mortality awareness". (I'm guessing pretty low).
