Last week I was contacted through LinkedIn by a stranger asking for help in forming a nonprofit organization. I get these types of requests not infrequently---whether directly through this blog, [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bensheldon) or Aardvark---or on mailing lists like Mission Based Massachusetts. My response is usually "Why does your cause necessitate its own 501(c)3? Have you considered [Fiscal Sponsorship](http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/tutorials/fiscal/index.html)?"

I subscribe to the belief that when you're working within a formal organization, 50% of your time goes towards maintaining organizational function and only the remainder actually goes towards achieving your external mission. **Bringing a mission to scale may require a formal organization eventually, but if you're trying to **[fail faster](http://authentic.gilbert.org/2006/11/02/why-fail/)**, is incorporation necessary now?**

The nonprofit sector is already rich with existing organizations and platforms from which you can act. While I don't share in the delusion that it's [one big lovefest](http://www.island94.org/2006/10/nonprofit-competition-concept-map/), there are structures in place to incubate unincorporated projects, give tax-exempt status, and even provide administrative, finance, legal and payroll support. Sure, Fiscal Sponsorship usually carries with it an administration fee (shop around), but even at 20% it could be less than the opportunity cost of you doing all that yourself _while_ trying to achieve your mission.

**So that's how the nonprofit sector lets you do more with less: you don't even need your own nonprofit to participate.**
