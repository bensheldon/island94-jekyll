Erin McKean makes the point in a [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/erin_mckean_redefines_the_dictionary.html) that, unlike paper dictionaries, online dictionary searches do not provide serendipity: finding something you didn't know you were looking for.

I take this many ways:

True, but...

How many people regularly flip a dictionary?

How exact is search?

How many people just type the word into Google (which, because internet search sucks, is quite serendipitous).
