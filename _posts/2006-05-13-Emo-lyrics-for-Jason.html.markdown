> Sunday comes it's raaaaining,

> My girl's here, she's taaaaaking

> ...her time

> I want to fly away

> So I won't have to say...

> Give me my voice

> It's making this choice

> So hard to take.

> Summer can't sustaaaain me,

> The music's on, the paaaaarty

> ...will start

> I think I'll walk away

> So I won't have to say...

> Give me some noise

> It's taking my joy

> Resigned to fate.
