This year's [Symposium on Values, Spirit and Business](http://www.sbnboston.org/sbn15/component/content/article/21-sbn-site-specific/100-symposium-spirtuality-and-business-2009) has the theme "How to Grow Your Business by Integrating the Gandhian Philosophy of Satyagraha".  The Wikipedia has [this to say on Satyagraha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha)---and that "passive resistance" is not descriptive of its tenets---:

> Gandhi contrasted satyagraha (holding on to truth) with “duragraha” (holding on by force), as in protest meant more to harass than enlighten opponents. He wrote: “There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.”
