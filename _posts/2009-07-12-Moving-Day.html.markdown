Visiting Western Massachussetts this weekend---Angelina sang at Tanglewood---we visited the [Norman Rockwell Museum](http://www.nrm.org/). It was beautiful in the Berkshires and while I can't speak to the comprehensiveness of the collection, it was just what I wanted. Norman Rockwell is one of my favorite americana motifs to wallow in.

At the museum's center was the Four Freedoms paintings. The feeling I had from reading that speech in high school---and the Port Huron Statement in college---is one of my most comforting whenever I get bogged in the cynicism of politics: that the current state of affairs (whatever they may be) is not for lack of dreams.

When looking at the paintings, I had to remind myself of the false appeal I hear to _better times. _As I learned from the museum, much of what I consider fantasy was that---the policy during the Great Depression was to avoid grim reality---or the lack of color among faces---the policy of the Saturday Evening Post was to only show african-americans if they were performing a service job.

As a tool, the drawings make a powerful message for equality and pluralism: Isn't _this_ wonderful? Shouldn't have this idyllic life. This shouldn't be an America reserved for just one race or class. Which brings up what all this harkens too---and ironically in this context, I am least moved by the _I have a dream _part_---_is that these paintings are the promissory notes of which all should be able to cash.
