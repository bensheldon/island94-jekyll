An [article on nonprofit challenges](http://www.yorkshire-culture.co.uk/News/Articles/The_seven_key_challenges_for_non-profit_organisations.html) from the British org Yorkshire Culture:

> In business, we are told that the customer is king; in the non-profit sector it is more like Jack, Queen and King — multiple stakeholders ranging from funders, to brokers to end users. The problem is that the end user or recipient often has very little say in what is being ‘purchased’ on their behalf. To most non-profit organisations the crucial relationship is that shared with the funder or broker, not the end user. If cultural non-profit organisations are to fully exploit their enterprise potential, relationships need to be rebalanced.

1. Satisfying the needs of the funders

2. Pricing and cost

3. Unwilling funders

4. Restricted income

5. Handling surplus

6. Investment problem

7. Overheads in service delivery
