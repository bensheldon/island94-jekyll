Brandon Weaver's ["Beyond Senior - Metric Obsessions"](https://dev.to/baweaver/beyond-senior-metric-obsessions-1j7p) has been stuck in my mind ever since we caught up at a Ruby Meetup and chatted about rules-adherence as a general problem:



<blockquote markdown="1">
...by definition a vast majority of your engineers are likely to be concentrated more towards the novice end of the spectrum, and will frequently over rate themselves on this scale.

If folks in the novice to advanced beginner stages are known for a rigid adherence to rules and almost legalistic approach to them what do you think might happen if you give them a giant list of metrics [and coding rules, linter warnings, dependency violations, type-checking warnings]?

Will they exercise discretion and nuance? Will they have the ability to prioritize based on that information? Will they make appropriate tradeoffs?

More likely, and what I've frequently seen in my own career, is that it becomes a numbers game very quickly... [No]
