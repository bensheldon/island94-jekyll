Meet my new cat, Jose Pierpont ("Ponty"). I got him a few weeks ago from the MSPCA and he's somewhere in that adolescent cat phase between 10 months and a year old. He's pretty awesome, though he has a strong penchant for pipe cleaners. [more pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensheldon/sets/72157604097747478/)
