**The Home Office**

Laptop, calendar, cellphone, sunlight, cat.

Molly is cute, furry and warm. She doesn't take dictation though.

**The Work Office**

A hardened concrete box deep in the windowless bowels of UMass Boston. Not my desk, but respective.

Danielle is hardworking, hilarious and awesome. She doesn't take dictation either.
