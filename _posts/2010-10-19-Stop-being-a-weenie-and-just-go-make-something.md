From a Frank Chimero jam: ["How to Have an Idea"](http://www.frankchimero.com/idea/):

> Stop being a weenie and just go make something. Judge its value after you finish and before you share.
>
> An observation: Creative people romanticize mistakes and process. But there is no process if you don't start. No one crumples a blank sheet of paper.
