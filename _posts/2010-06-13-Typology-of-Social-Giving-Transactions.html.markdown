- **Giving**: a gift. _"Please take this dollar. Have a nice day."_
- **Mercy**: a gift to someone of lower social class. _"Please take this dollar. But don't buy beer with it."_
- **Charity**: a gift to someone of similar social class. _"Here is 50 dollars for your cause. Have you tried the shrimp?"_
- **Donation**: an exchange with the expectation of tax deductability. _"Here is 50 dollars. Can I please have a receipt?"_
- **Philanthropy**: a gift of social magnificence. _"Here is 1,000 dollars. Do you have my name spelled correctly for the placque?"_

_Note: There types do loosely overlap; charitable donations probably make up the majority of transactions. _
