I work in Lowell, MA, an old mill city criss-crossed with canals. In New England, the Fall leaves are at first beautiful on the trees, then gross as they litter the sidewalks, roads, and as I found out, waterways as well. When I first saw this canal I thought there had been a chemical spill. Upon closer inspection, I saw that it was just Autumn leaves.
