I hate to repost ironic internet memes, but [this from reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9ycx7/you_are_to_assume_the_role_of_a_chinese_immigrant/) touches upon pedagogy and (attempts at) representing other perspectives. From the comments:

> "Write me a letter from the point of view of [you name it]." This is a typical mistake made by middle class teachers who don't -really- know what the world looks like through the eyes of somebody from a different background. .

And more straightforward:

> These sorts of assignments are bullshit anyway. The average letter anyone from any age would write would typically be banal and not cover significant historical aspects. The letter demanded by this situation would probably be full of family specific greetings and quotidian insights. I doubt a realistic letter would get good marks from the teacher though!

> If they want an essay about a topic, they should just ask for one, rather than dress up the question in this way. [---](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9ycx7/you_are_to_assume_the_role_of_a_chinese_immigrant/c0f1623)

In case you're curious, this is the translated text:

> My life here is terrible. Work environment is not great and benefits are little. But don't worry, everyday only about 10 people are seriously injured and I'm very careful. We opened a small shop, business isn't bad. Although I don't understand very much English, but I can still understand what white men say. Hopefully we can become successful, I will work hard and take care of myself.

> Are you guys well? Miss you very much, hope to see you again [.---](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9ycx7/you_are_to_assume_the_role_of_a_chinese_immigrant/c0f0dks)

Other examples mentioned in the comments [are](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9ycx7/you_are_to_assume_the_role_of_a_chinese_immigrant/c0f0lfv) "Write a journal entry from the point of view of an English explorer seeing Africans for the first time" [and](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9ycx7/you_are_to_assume_the_role_of_a_chinese_immigrant/c0f18yk) "Write one set in the present day about if Germany had won WW2 (and had invaded the UK in doing so)."
