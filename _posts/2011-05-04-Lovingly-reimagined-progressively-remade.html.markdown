Chris Rabb's _Invisible Capital_ uses a quote from Robert Mangabeira Unger and Cornel West's _The Future of American Progressivism:_

> “To understand your country, you must love it. To love it, you must, in a sense, accept it. To accept it as how it is, however is to betray it. To accept your country without betraying it, you must love it for that in it which shows what it might become. America---this monument to the genius of ordinary men and women, this place where hope becomes capacity, this long, halting turn of the no into the yes---needs citizens who love it enough to reimagine and remake it."
