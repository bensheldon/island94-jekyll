Augustine of Hippo's [taxonomy of lies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Augustine.27s_taxonomy_of_lies), deduced from his book _On Lying (De Mendacio)_ (395) in order of descending severity:

> - Lies in religious teaching.
> - Lies that harm others and help no one.
> - Lies that harm others and help someone.
> - Lies told for the pleasure of lying.
> - Lies told to "please others in smooth discourse."
> - Lies that harm no one and that help someone.
> - Lies that harm no one and that save someone's life.
> - Lies that harm no one and that save someone's "purity."

Svenn Lindskold and Pamela Walters reduce those by 2---though Augustine's previous work is uncited--- in "Categories for the Acceptability of Lies" (1983). Listed from least permissible to most.

> 1. Telling a lie that hurts someone else so that you can gain. In social motivational terms these categories can be said to range from
> 2. Telling a lie that, if successful, could cause others to do something that beneﬁts you while, at the same time, harming themselves or causing themselves a loss.
> 3. Telling a lie to make yourself appear better than you really are or to protect some gain, acquired some time ago, to which you were not really entitled.
> 4. Telling a lie that will inﬂuence others in an ofﬁcial position in such a way that you will gain by their response to you, but they will not be harmed.
> 5. Telling a lie to protect yourself or another from punishment or disapproval for a minor failing or blunder which hurts no one.
> 6. Telling a lie to save others from minor hurt, shame, or embarrassment.
