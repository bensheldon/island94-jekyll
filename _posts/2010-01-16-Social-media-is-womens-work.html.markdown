Some [new commentary](http://thelearnedfangirl.com/2009/12/13/thinking-out-loud-is-social-media-the-new-pink-collar-ghetto-of-tech/) on the evolving nature of women's work, as a follow-up to comments on [gender-driven compensation in social work](http://www.island94.org/2009/10/social-work-is-womens-work-so-we-dont-care/):

> ....as the social media world becomes more and more female-driven (after all, social media power  users tend to be female) will it become “demoted” in the tech industry, seen as a “soft” profession with lower comparative salaries and less room for professional advancement/leadership? Has that already happened?
