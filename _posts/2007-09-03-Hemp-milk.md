Info on [Hemp Milk](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07123/782900-34.stm).

I just bought some of this (Manitoba Harvest brand, the chocolate kind) at Whole Foods. It's not soy milk, but I'm not sure if it's any better. I kind've got a bit of a choke in the back of my throat on the first sip, though after that it was pretty smooth.
