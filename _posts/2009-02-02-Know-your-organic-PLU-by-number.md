I get a big [grab-box of organic produce](http://www.bostonorganics.com/) every week and last week I guess there was a bit of a mixup. I order it more for the variety and element of surprise (_what should I cook with celery root?_) than health or ideology, so the issue was more an opportunity to learn this fun fact:

> It was brought to our attention last week that some of the Asian Pears we distributed were not organic. We should have caught it as the price lookup code or “PLU code” on the sticker label was a number “4” instead of the number “9”; all organic PLU codes begin with the number “9”. 

Of course, that your produce even comes with a PLU is a different matter...
