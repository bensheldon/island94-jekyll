I put this chart together after a friend told me my project productivity was unusually high. I picked out the major web projects I've done over the past several years and highlight how they've influenced subsequent (or previous) projects. Every one of these projects launched or shipped... except the DigitalBicycle, which is why it holds a special place in influencing all Project Design (we never did make those "defunct" t-shirts).
