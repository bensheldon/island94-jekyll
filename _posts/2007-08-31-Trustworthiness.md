Just saw this [demo](http://trust.cse.ucsc.edu/) of an algorithm that rates the trustworthiness of Wikipedia articles. It computes the "trust" of authors by how long their edits stick around, then applies that to articles. (via [Slashdot](http://it.slashdot.org/it/07/08/31/0259224.shtml))

I wonder how it works on entries that are intentionally misleading, like the entry on [Discordianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism).
