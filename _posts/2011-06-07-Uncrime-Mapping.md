I really don't understand the appeal of crime maps. Trulia, a housing search tool, just launched a [crime map, too](http://www.trulia.com/crime/) (via [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/2011/06/02/trulia-crime-map-helps-you-find-safe-living-places/), whose commenters are full of criticism). Since Trulia doesn't have data (now _that's_ something to map with transformative potential) for Boston, I had to look up my [friends' neighborhood in Chicago](http://www.trulia.com/crime/#!cook-il/15/41.90543,-87.68471/Chicago,IL,Humboldt_Park/). Above is a heatmap I photoshopped showing the uncrime---the area is clearly rife with it.

Below is [McArthur's Universal Corrective Map of the World](http://www.odt.org/southupmaps.htm). Think about it.
