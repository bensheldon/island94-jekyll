Sent this off after some wild, though not misplaced, enthusiasm for Kickstarter, Indiegogo and a few other newish online fundraising services; the soft lead-in and enthusiastic closing paragraph are not included.

> No fundraising tool will replace an engaged membership who well-understands the necessity for monetarily supporting the organization's activities. Yes, a certain tool may be marginally more effective for certain kinds of asks or circumstances, but the common framing of tools (especially new/hot online tools) as alternatives to the regular grind of individual giving and relationship development ("cultivation") is a LIE.
>
> When evaluating any tool, the questions to ask is:
>
> 1. Why is our existing fundraising strategy/planning insufficient to meet the need for which this tool is the (potential/alleged) solution?
>
> 2. Why can't we ask our membership to fund the need directly or through existing channels?
>
> Which is not to take a reactive stance against any adoption of any new tool, but to ensure that we are investing in creating a stable base of individual donors who will fund us regularly and consistently---and building the organizational capacity to ask people for their money honestly, confidently and DIRECTLY.

> We believe these questions should be kept in mind when pursing funding:
>
> - How does funding sustain or improve something FreeGeek Chicago already does?
>
> - How does funding make FreeGeek more sustainable?
>
> - Who provides the funding? Do their values and behavior match FreeGeek's mission and values?
>
> - Has FreeGeek planned for the time when funding runs out? Where does it leave us?
>
> - What forms of overhead does the funding create? Do we have the organizational resources to properly manage the transactions?
>
> - What forms of accountability go along with the funding?
>
> - How could the obligations of funding affect our organizational structure and community process?
>
> - Can the goals of a funding source be better filled by another organization (either existing or to be created) outside of FreeGeek?
>
> - Does the funder require personal information from participants? Are we comfortable asking for that information?
