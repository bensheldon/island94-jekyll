<p>I’ve been thoroughly amused by the vetting process for political (and supposedly un-political) government positions. Recently there was the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26527513/">vetting for Sarah Palin</a>, VP for McCain’s Republican ticket:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Defending his choice and the team that helped pick her, McCain said Tuesday that “the vetting process was completely thorough.” Advisers said Palin went through a rigorous process that included a three-hour interview and a survey with some 70 questions, including: Have you ever paid for sex? Have you been faithful in your marriage? Have you ever used or purchased drugs? Have you ever downloaded pornography?</p>

<p>Those 5 questions are good to juxtapose against the Nexis <a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/07/report-former-j.html">search string Monica Goodling used to research applicants</a> to the Bush Attorney General’s office:</p>
