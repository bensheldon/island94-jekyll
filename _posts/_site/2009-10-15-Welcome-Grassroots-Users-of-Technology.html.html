<p>This weekend is the Organizers’ Collaborative’s (and our 20 wonderful <a href="http://www.grassrootstech.org/2009/node/7">sponsors</a>’) 10th Annual <a href="http://www.grassrootstech.org">Grassroots Use of Technology Conference</a> (still time to register!). I’m President of the Board for the <a href="http://organizerscollaborative.org">Organizers Collaborative</a>, so I’m a little excited. Even more so because I got top billing in the <a href="http://grassrootstech.org/2009/node/57">Program Booklet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome. We gather to celebrate as much as continue learning and sharing. When we began this conference 10 years ago, we expected computer and internet technology to become more important to advancing our vision for a progressive future. What we could not imagine then was that these tools would become the engines for political and social change we seek today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we met last year there was tremendous energy and excitement: the rapid-fire exchange of ideas and dreams was contagious as we hoped that we could finally turn the corner. I hope this year’s conference lacks none of that energy; but today we have an even greater opportunity for reflection on the tools and strategies we used, and the challenges we still face.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is any number of emerging technologies and tested strategies I could highlight, but that would miss the power of what we have to build upon. At the heart of any technology lies our own unamplified voices and minds. I am excited that we can gather here today to use and develop these very human tools: together we can better imagine the world we wish to live in, and the technology we’ll use to create it.</p>

<p>In 200 words there isn’t a whole lot of places to put things, but I’m satisfied that I nailed the important stuff.</p>
