<p>The New York Review of Books <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/dec/17/growing-up-female/?pagination=false">on <em>When Everything Changed: The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present</em></a> by Gail Collins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then came Betty Friedan. Her book, Collins writes, hit in 1963 “like an earthquake.” The shameful, confusing malaise felt by many women after the war now had a legitimate source, and the source had a name: The Feminine Mystique. Friedan busted the myth of the happy housewife so thoroughly that it took decades before women who were happy housewives dared to say anything about it. Women, Friedan said, “were being duped into believing homemaking was their natural destiny.” The dueling desires of motherhood and selfhood were articulated at last, and the feminist movement turned from the clear-cut demands of suffragism and equal pay to the less-defined realm of empowerment.</p>

<p>Accordingly, criticism of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_feminism">Third Wave Feminism</a> is quite similar to <a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/08/from-self-actualization-to-neo-liberalism/">that of self-actualization</a> (from Rushkoff’s <em>Life, Inc.</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of fueling people to do something about the world, as the Weathermen and Yippies had hoped, spirituality became a way of changing one’s own perspectives, one’s own experiences and one’s own self. By pushing through to the other side of personal liberation, the descendants of Reich once again found self-adjustment the surest path to happiness.</p>
