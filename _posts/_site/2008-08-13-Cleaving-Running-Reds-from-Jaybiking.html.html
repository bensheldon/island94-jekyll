<p>Great article on why <a href="http://www.thewashcycle.com/2008/07/the-myth-of-the.html?cid=126259538#comment-126259538">drivers call the kettle black</a> when they complain about bicyclists break road-laws. I found interesting the distinction between running a red light and jaywalking/riding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s talk about red-light running. There are two types of red-light running. “Catching an orange” - or running the start of a red light - which every class of users does. And jaywalking or jaybiking - waiting for the intersection to clear and then crossing against the light - which only pedestrians and cyclists do.</p>

<p>Also, covers interesting analysis of why there isn’t such a thing as jaydriving. Though, as I commented, in my hometown it was pretty common to drive through a red light, late at night.</p>
