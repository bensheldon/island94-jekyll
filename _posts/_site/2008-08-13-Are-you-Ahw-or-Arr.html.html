<p>Via some <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/08/12/toastabags-grill-che.html">fun copy</a> on BoingBoing Gadgets (“These “Toastabags” (phonemologically Bostonian, apparently…”) and someone’s <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/08/12/toastabags-grill-che.html#comment-258382">analytical comment</a></p>

<p>, I came across a way to cleave English speakers: those that pronounce R’s (rhotic), and those that don’t(non-rhotic). From the wikipedia page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents">Rhotic and non-rhotic accents</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>English pronunciation is divided into two main accent groups, the rhotic (pronounced /ˈroʊtɪk/) and non-rhotic, depending on when the sound typically represented in spelling with the letter R is pronounced. Rhotic speakers pronounce written /r/ in all positions, while non-rhotic speakers pronounce /r/ only if it is followed by a vowel sound (see “linking and intrusive R”), and not always even then.</p>
