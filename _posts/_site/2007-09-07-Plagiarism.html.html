<p>I could care less about the politics, but it’s interesting to see that a congresswoman was <a href="http://www.dccc.org/stakeholder/archives/005317.html">caught </a>“plagiarizing” (“borrowing” or “incorporating” if you want to play the pronoun game) in a newspaper column via “a program that monitors high school and college student papers for acts of copying and forgery”. (via <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/09/07/schmidt-caught-plagiarizing-in-newspaper-column/">ThinkProgress.org</a>)</p>

<p>I didn’t realize that people were using things like <a href="http://turnitin.com/">Turn It In</a> for non-schoolwork.</p>

<p>Not that I’d want to cite Johnny 10th Grader, but I wonder if their algorithm/database would work for looking for references (which then you could *properly* cite).</p>
