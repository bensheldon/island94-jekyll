<p>Another excerpt from Gift Hub, <a href="http://www.gifthub.org/2011/06/by-besty-brill-and-ken-nopar-in-step-journal-directed-to-estate-planning-professionals-little-by-little-tax-and-legal-profe.html">“Conducting the Charitable Giving Conversation as a Rational Person Would”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Little by little tax and legal professionals are coming to see that the wealthy very often want to have impact beyond self and family. How to have a conversation about aspiration and impact? Not easy for those whose training is limited to facts and figures. The skills needed are those of Socratic dialogue and thematic listening. Those who have such skills are generally found in public relations, advertising, proof reading, teaching, social work, fundrasing, or walking the streets looking for a job. We have, as a culture, subordinated wisdom to profit and now our best hope is to teach “discernment” to tax, legal, and financial professionals. The strategic part of philanthropy can be taught by MBAs, and often is. The wisdom part? We are still treating giving as a consumer preference or proclivity. Questions like, “What does the community need? To whom are you responsible? What must we do to be saved? If not now when?” are syptomatic of a mind gone mad. I know it and accept it.</p>
