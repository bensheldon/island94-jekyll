<p>At the Grassroots Use of Technology Conference / National Writers Union Digital Media Conference I got to hear a lot of people bemoan how hard it is to make a buck as a creator in the digital age.</p>

<p>A comparison was made to the Open Source Software movement and I made a very quotable statement ( <a href="http://twitter.com/SeerGenius/statuses/4931348990">by Twitter standards</a>): “Journalism is the software upon which democracy runs”.</p>

<p>Other than the awful mixed metaphors, I think I made a good statement: coding software has a very clear correlation between the work itself and the measurement of the final product at the end. Journalism: not so much. Of course some people <em>do</em> talk about how access to information and analysis from diverse viewpoints is vital to the continued health of our Democracy, but they <a href="http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/media_literacy/bias/glenn_beck_attacks_local_media2139">get shouted down by Glen Beck</a>. Newspapers themselves (or Cable Access TV or whatever is going town the toilet today) are usually discussed as some impalpable, circularly-reasoned necessity rather than put into context as <em>providers of a what __is necessary for the kind of society we want to live in.</em></p>

<p>Call me progressive, but let’s talk about what we need to build tomorrow, not reinforce today.</p>

<p>Here’s a quote I <a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/08/from-self-actualization-to-neo-liberalism/">have trouble disagreeing with</a> from Mark Lloyd’s <a href="http://www.comtechreview.org/winter-spring-1998/r981lloy.htm"><em>Communications Policy is a Civil Rights Issue</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…to argue that getting out of the business of regulation is the only constructive role for government to play is as blind as it is disingenuous. The challenge is to create a set of rules that reflects the best nature of our society. As Newton Minow makes clear in <em>Abandoned in the Wasteland,</em> the issue is not really whether the market provides good choices, but whether citizens have a real say in what those choices are. The issue is whether the parent must let his child be a consumer, or, more to the point, a product to be sold to advertisers, or whether the parent has a right as a citizen to demand more.</p>
