<p>A great comment from <a href="http://nonprofitable.org/">Tom Wolf</a> showed up in my feed reader; left on a <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Oct/19/upgrades/">quote</a> by <a href="http://www.marco.org/217159338">Marco Arment</a> on <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Oct/19/upgrades/">Simon Willison’s blog</a>:</p>

  <p>Over a decade ago when I started a program to teach senior citizens how to use computers (Windows 95, WordPerfect, and dial-up internet access :), the first day that I had them at the computer, I encouraged them to do their best to “break” it in order to remove some of their fear about doing just that.</p>

  <p>Students who internalized my message of “there’s no way you can screw this up so bad that I can’t fix it” learned much, much faster.

  <p>Finally, the fact that there are hordes of so-called consultants out there who enhance these perceptions and prey on the average users’ lack of understanding to charge outrageous prices for sub-par (or in some cases no) work is incredibly frustrating.</p>
