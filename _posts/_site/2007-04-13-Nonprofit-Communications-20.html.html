<p>Last week I attended NTEN’s 2007 <a href="http://nten.org/ntc">Nonprofit Technology Conference</a> and sat in on a wonderful session entitled <strong>Nonprofit Communications 2.0: Seven Steps to Transform Your Organization.</strong> Led by <a href="http://www.cctv.org/index.php?SiteAlias=cctv&amp;PageAlias=CCTV_Staff#LG">Lauren-Glenn Davitian</a> of the <a href="http://www.cctv.org/">CCTV Center for Media and Democracy</a>, the session provided a strong framework for nonprofits to better communicate in an increasingly networked society.</p>

<p>I am also very lucky to serve with Lauren-Glenn on the editorial board of the <a href="http://communitymediareview.org/">Community Media Review</a>.</p>

<p>The video itself is approximately 1 hour, 24 minutes long and worth every second, but I included my notes from the session below.</p>

<h3 id="the-seven-steps">The Seven Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Assessment</strong>: Defining your goal (What behavior are you trying to change in undertaking a communications strategy?), audience (an explicit, targeted “who” and their values), evaluating your infrastructure (orthodoxies, structure, time, leadership)</li>
  <li><strong>Awareness</strong>: Start by searching <a href="http://nten.org">NTEN</a>, <a href="http://techsoup.org">TechSoup</a>, <a href="http://www.idealware.org/">Idealware</a>, etc. (Link Research)</li>
  <li><strong>Training</strong>: A discipline of doing things. How are stories told, infrastructure built and actions communicated to regular people?</li>
  <li><strong>Content Production</strong>: “The currency of the new world”</li>
  <li><strong>Technical Support</strong>: An example: how to know when to build and when to buy</li>
  <li><strong>Partnerships</strong>: Who is going to stand up for you?</li>
  <li><strong>Planning</strong>: What are the components that revolve around your goal?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I shot this video with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Casio-Exilim-EX-S600-Digital-Optical/dp/B000E158D4">Casio EX-S600</a>, which shoots full-frame (640 x 480) MPEG-4 video. With a two gigabyte SD Card it can shoot approximately an hour and a half of video at medium quality before its battery dies. The Casio’s AVI wrapper is incompatible with iMovie (or any Quicktime decoder), so I first used <a href="http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/">VisualHub</a> to repackage the video as an MP4 before importing into iMovie to add titles. I exported from iMovie as DV and then converted that with VisualHub into MPEG-4. Compressed and at quarter-frame (320 x 240) the entire video was 105 MB. This time I uploaded to Google Video since <a href="http://blip.tv">Blip.tv</a> stalled out.</em></p>
