<p>2nd rate band’s new single appears on bittorrent sites, band releases press release decrying leak, <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/band-leaks-track-to-bittorrent-blames-pirates-080731/">sleuthing ensues</a>…turns out the band’s manager leaked the track himself. Damning on its own, but the interesting part is the forensic sleuthing that led to outing the guilty party:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With some help of a user in the community, we tracked down some of the initial seeders of the torrent. A BitTorrent site insider was kind enough to help us out, because BitTorrent is not supposed to be “abused” like this, and confirmed that the IP of one of the early seeders did indeed belong to the person who uploaded the torrent file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It turns out that the uploader, a New York resident, had only uploaded one torrent, the BuckCherry track. When we entered the IP-address into the <a href="http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/">Wiki-scanner</a>, we found out that the person in question had edited the BuckCherry wikipedia entry, and added the name of the band manager to another page.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This confirmed our suspicions, but it was not quite enough, since it could be an overly obsessed fan (if they have fans). So, we decided to send the band manager, Josh Klemme - who happens to live in New York - an email to ask for his opinion on our findings. Klemme, replied to our email within a few hours, and surprisingly enough his IP-address was the same as the uploader.</p>
