<p>It’s another election year which means that politics are flying.</p>

<p>From a story on <a href="http://www.townhall.com/news/sci-tech/2008/06/02/nasas_own_watchdog_agency_misled_on_global_warming">NASA forcibly downplaying global warming</a>:</p>

  <p>The report did not directly accuse them of lying, but used more nuanced terms such as “<strong>mendacity</strong> ** <a href="http://time-travel.com/?abandoned">Abandoned</a>** “ and “<strong>dissembling</strong>.” The space agency complained those terms were unjust.</p>

<p>And I enjoy how the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/us/politics/17policy.html?pagewanted=2&amp;hp">describes a John McCain statement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like Mr. Bush, Mr. McCain has steadfastly refused to set dates for withdrawals of troops and envisions a long-term American presence in the country. But last month, in the general election battleground state of Ohio, Mr. McCain did a <strong>semantic dance</strong> and said he expected that most American troops would be home from Iraq by 2013.</p>
