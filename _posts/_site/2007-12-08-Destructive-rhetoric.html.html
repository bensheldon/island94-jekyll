<p>I was having a hard time explaining exactly what Fred Turner means by the conclusion of his book, <em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture,</em> I <a href="http://island94.org/close-machine">wrote about earlier</a>. It really seems difficult to explain things without using informationalist rhetoric.</p>

<p>This makes me think of the <a href="http://www.wealthbondage.com/2005/05/the_constructio.html">About Wealth Bondage page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wealth Bondage is pervasive, the horizon within which postmodern life, in every aspect, appears to us as a Market….</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>All interpretations of Wealth Bondage are themselves inside Wealth Bondage and as such are provisional, for there is not “outside” of Wealth Bondage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not entirely sure what the heck that means, but if I were to be all thinky, I could try to connect the idea of Bakhtin’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogism">Dialogic</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>everything anybody ever says always exists in response to things that have been said before and in anticipation of things that will be said in response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a> and suppose that certain rhetorical “memes” (like peer-to-peer informationalism or market exchange) are able to, within the diologic, competitively displace other rhetorical memes.</p>
