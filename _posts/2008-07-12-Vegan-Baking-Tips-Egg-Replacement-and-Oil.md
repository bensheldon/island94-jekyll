During an AmeriCorps icebreaker, I matched my desire to learn vegan baking with someone who knew how. Who say's icebreakers are worthless (well, I sometimes do). I got the following two tips:

**Egg Substitute**: Use an amount of water equal to an egg (maybe ~1/4 cup) and mix in tablespoon of ground flax-seed

**Best Oil**: Coconut Oil is the best oil to use for moistness and tastiness. Of course, it's really bad for you, but who cares.
