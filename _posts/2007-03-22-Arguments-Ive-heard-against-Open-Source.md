When planning a dynamic website, using [Open Source Software](http://nonprofiteye.blogspot.com/2006/11/non-profit-open-source.html) (OSS) can make a lot of sense. I think there is enough information [out there](http://technorati.com/search/open+source+is+awesome "technorati search: 'open source is awesome'") about why OSS is the cat's meow, so here are a few reasons I've hear from people that _don't_ want to use Open Source Software for their web development projects:

- **"I don't know anything about it"** is a common refrain I hear from larger institutions. This usually translates as "I don't know _anyone_ that does it". Oftentimes larger organizations will have established relationships---historical, contractual or personal---with proprietary developers.

- **"All the examples are really awful"** is a statement I have to agree with, but fortunately there is an explanation. Open Source CMS software like [Drupal](http://drupal.org) or [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) is free and relatively easy to use. Thus these systems have an enormous number of people using them; people with no design or development experience. Therefore there exists a very small signal-to-noise ratio of beautiful and usable websites to poorly designed or out-of-the-box examples. This means you're much more likely to run across the latter.

- **"I hear it's insecure"** is a common and legitimate concern whether you're using open source software, buying a proprietary system, or building from the ground up. Unfortunately, the explanation for this common refrain is very similar to the aesthetic complaint: because the install base of these systems is so large, there exist many more instances of improper or unsafe configurations or failures to properly update software.
