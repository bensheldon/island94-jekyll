From Marianne M. Jennings' _The Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse: How to Spot Moral Meltdowns in Companies... Before It's Too Late_:

> **Sign #7: Goodness in some areas atones for evil in others**
>
> ...Beware the socially responsible company. Watch out for the big donors. There is a certain con component in the Yeehaw Culture. The con men and women of the Yeehaw Culture have ﬁgured out a formula for drawing attention away from company performance and, in many cases, its ﬁnancials. Even without the Yeehaw Culture, this dedication to causes and charity seems to be a distraction from running the business. The result is not just a lack of focus, but also a diversion of funds that were needed for simple things, including, for example, the employees' pensions. That distraction comes in the form of virtuous efforts in the community, charities, and all those social goals one can now ﬁnd on pretty much every company's website. Stunningly, that information will be located on the investor-information home page. As cynical as it seems, skepticism about social responsibility and philanthropy may be one of the most certain determinants of a Yeehaw Culture. If you ﬁnd these present in a company, check for the other factors of ethical collapse because the generosity and service may be a cover in a troubled soul and even more troubled books.

The term "yeehaw culture" comes from the Wyoming Law Reviews' "Restoring Ethical Gumption in the Corporation: A Federalist Paper on Corporate Governance---Restoration of Active Virtue in the Corporate Structure to Curb the 'Yeehaw Culture' in Organizations". It's also the cry of Billy Crystal in _City Slickers_.

The book also encourages researching the community connections between management and charities.
