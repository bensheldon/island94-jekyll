Last week I attended NTEN's 2007 [Nonprofit Technology Conference](http://nten.org/ntc) and sat in on a wonderful session entitled **Nonprofit Communications 2.0: Seven Steps to Transform Your Organization.** Led by [Lauren-Glenn Davitian](http://www.cctv.org/index.php?SiteAlias=cctv&PageAlias=CCTV_Staff#LG) of the [CCTV Center for Media and Democracy](http://www.cctv.org/), the session provided a strong framework for nonprofits to better communicate in an increasingly networked society.

I am also very lucky to serve with Lauren-Glenn on the editorial board of the [Community Media Review](http://communitymediareview.org/).

The video itself is approximately 1 hour, 24 minutes long and worth every second, but I included my notes from the session below.

> Community building talent is the single most important resource in the modern world.

Peter Drucker

### How to engage and mobilize members

A Communications framework for thinking about how organizational objectives are met through interaction. The correlating Development framework is in parenthesis.

1. **Welcome** (Prospect)
2. **Educate** (Cultivation)
3. **Ask** (Involvement)
4. **Thank** (Stewardship)

### The Seven Steps

1. **Assessment**: Defining your goal (What behavior are you trying to change in undertaking a communications strategy?), audience (an explicit, targeted "who" and their values), evaluating your infrastructure (orthodoxies, structure, time, leadership)
2. **Awareness**: Start by searching [NTEN](http://nten.org), [TechSoup](http://techsoup.org), [Idealware](http://www.idealware.org/), etc. (Link Research)
3. **Training**: A discipline of doing things. How are stories told, infrastructure built and actions communicated to regular people?
4. **Content Production**: "The currency of the new world"
5. **Technical Support**: An example: how to know when to build and when to buy
6. **Partnerships**: Who is going to stand up for you?
7. **Planning**: What are the components that revolve around your goal?

_I shot this video with a [Casio EX-S600](http://www.amazon.com/Casio-Exilim-EX-S600-Digital-Optical/dp/B000E158D4), which shoots full-frame (640 x 480) MPEG-4 video. With a two gigabyte SD Card it can shoot approximately an hour and a half of video at medium quality before its battery dies. The Casio's AVI wrapper is incompatible with iMovie (or any Quicktime decoder), so I first used [VisualHub](http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/) to repackage the video as an MP4 before importing into iMovie to add titles. I exported from iMovie as DV and then converted that with VisualHub into MPEG-4. Compressed and at quarter-frame (320 x 240) the entire video was 105 MB. This time I uploaded to Google Video since [Blip.tv](http://blip.tv) stalled out._
