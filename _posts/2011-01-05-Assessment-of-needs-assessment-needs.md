One of my AmeriCorps members asked for resources on technology needs-assessment surveys and I came across some varied approaches. Above is from the US Department of Education hosted _[An Educator's Guide to Evaluating the Use of Technology in Schools and Classrooms](http://www2.ed.gov/pubs/EdTechGuide/appc-5.html)_. Below is from the National Center for Technology Planning's " [Perceived Educational Technology Needs Survey](http://www.nctp.com/downloads/assess.pdf)" [PDF] (the Center appears to be more a guy then a center). Both appear rather aged, though I like the latter one better.

> _Note to the respondent: Please keep this questionnaire in your possession for the survey interval in your usual work location while performing your customary duties. Make entries to the items as appropriate responses occur to you. Your responses will help inform the technology planning process about the best application of technologies in your teaching situation._
