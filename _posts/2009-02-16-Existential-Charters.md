I just finished reading a New York Times editorial " [Is the Supreme Court About to Kill Off the Exclusionary Rule?](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/opinion/16mon4.html?partner=rss&emc=rss)" that ended with this line:

> “Nothing can destroy a government more quickly,” the [Federal Supreme Court noted in Mapp v. Ohio], “than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the charter of its own existence.”

I also just finished reading Cory Doctorow's [Little Brother](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Brother-Cory-Doctorow/dp/0765319853?tag=particculturf-20) (which you can [download free](http://www.feedbooks.com/book/2466) under Creative Commons).
