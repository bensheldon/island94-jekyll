I really like this post from Entry Level Living about [the need for nonprofits and for-profits to collaborate](http://entrylevelliving.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/sector-divisions-collaboration/) in these dicy economic times. She lays out some good examples of collaboration and ties it into a compelling sandwich. But it also begins with a an false cliche (nonprofits war with the for-profits) and doesn't actually get beyond the the assumption that _collaboration_ is an intrinsic good. The interesting and unanswered piece (for anyone who isn't a millennial, like the Allison of Entry Level Living and I) is: _why the hooey should we care about collaboration?_

The answer: you shouldn't. **You should care about creating value**, collaboration is just a means to getting there (and not the only one, at that). Entry Level Living lays out some fine examples that do create value, but doesn't provide a strict method for thinking about value-creation.

So let's talk about value:

Nonprofits tend to talk more about values---our mission, our vision, our culture of caring---than the _value_ (no 's') we create. Most of the value we do talk about is tied up into our values. The [value theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_theory#Economics) of nonprofits mostly has to do with creating moral goods: things someone is morally obligated to strive for (education, self-reliance, non-violence, positive familial and community relations, etc.). In [nonprofit parlance](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/4969.html) that is called _Social Value_.

We tend not to talk about the _Economic Value_ we have: our brand and name-recognition; our well-developed skills or expertise; and our general social authority and legitimacy (a fancy way of saying people trust us)... to name a few.

While Social Value is good (duh!), it has no meaning in cross-sector collaboration: it's just not the business of business. Economic Value _is_ meaningful for cross-sector collaboration, and that's where nonprofits should be spending their time. If you've ever heard someone say " [Monetize your Core Competencies](http://island94.org/node/155/)", they're talking about your Economic Value, not your Social one.

So now that you know about value, how do you create it in cross-sector collaboration? To begin with, we're going to toss the word _collobaration_ and replace it with a broader and more neutral term: **negotiation**. While collaboration may be a strategy within negotiation, negotiation encompasses the entire scope of communication that you may be engaged in.

Cross-sector negotiation means thinking of creative ways to combine your nonprofit's Economic Value with a for-profit's Economic Value in such a way that you _create more value than existed in the first place._. In negotiation theory, this is called "joint value". In more metaphorical terms, you've just [enlarged the pie](http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/creating_value/).

For example, if you've ever had a corporate volunteer day, you've done exactly this: you combined your social authority and legitimacy as do gooders with a for-profit's staff-as-volunteers. The for-profit received CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) PR and personal development (the warm fuzzies) for staff; you received cheap labor; and both of you did it for less than the cost of an alternative plan (advertising campaign and professional staff development for them; part-time paid labor for you).

Nonprofits and for-profits aren't at war; they are just similar looking games with somewhat different rules. The secret to winning is to look for cross-over skills, strategies and players. Evaluating the economic value of your nonprofit is a good place to start.
