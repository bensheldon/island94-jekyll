From the [New York State Constitution](http://www.dos.state.ny.us/info/constitution.htm):

> Article 1, Section 17. Labor of human beings is not a commodity nor an article of commerce and shall never be so considered or construed.

As a result of thisÂ  [_Newshour_ report on the Mott's worker strike](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec10/mott_09-06.html): "Workers who feel they're now being treated as a commodity in a land of excess labor."
