One should never be too surprised by what they might find in a restroom. I was _impressed_ though with what I learned from a sign hanging above a urinal at the National Zoo in Washington, DC. **"Spray it, don't say it!** **_Urine spraying is ok--if you're a lobster that is_** Lobsters don't speak, but they do greet--by spraying urine at each other. That's one one way they communicate..." There was another person in the restroom washing his hands when I took the picture; I calmly allayed any fears he may have had by telling him, "It's okay, I'm a photographer."
