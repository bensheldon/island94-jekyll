Came across this quote from John Kenneth Galbraith in a presentation by L. Carson of the University of Sydney about [Strategic Questioning (pdf)](http://sydney.edu.au/ab/faculty_review/docs/strategic_questioning.pdf):

> Faced with the choice between changing oneâ€™s mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.
