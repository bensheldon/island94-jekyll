> Ingredients:
>
> 2 oz ground almonds
>
> 6 oz self-raising flour
>
> 2 tsp baking powder
>
> 4 oz light muscovado sugar
>
> 150 ml corn oil
>
> 200-250 ml soy milk
>
> zest of 2 unwaxed lemons
>
> juice of 2 lemons
>
> 1 tbsp orange flower water . . . not sure what this is
>
> 1 tsp vanilla/ natural vanilla extract
>
> Preheat the oven to 190 degrees (given that this is a British book, I'm guessing convert to F -- maybe 325ish?), or less if it's a fan oven.
>
> Grease a cake tin. A deep 6 inch tin is good but any will do.
>
> Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl and then add the sugar. Mix in the ground almonds and lemon zest. Add the oil and soymilk.
>
> Use slightly less liquid to make the end result more of a cake and less of a pudding. You don't have to be 100 per cent precise with
>
> the liquids in this cake.
>
> Now add the lemon juice and mix in thoroughly. Add the flower water and the vanilla and mix again. The result
>
> should look like a thick batter.
>
> Pour into the cake tin and bake for about 40 min. The outside should be brown and inside very soft. Turn out, cool and decorate with fresh mint leaves and strawberries.
