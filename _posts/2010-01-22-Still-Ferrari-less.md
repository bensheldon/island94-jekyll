> After all, there's nothing quite like driving your Ferrari home to your 6,000 square foot mansion after a long, hard day of fighting for the cause.
This is how Amy Bell ended a polemic (even by my standards) against exorbitant nonprofit executive compensation, published in Forbes in December as " [Nonprofit Millionaires](http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/17/nonprofits-biggest-salaries-personal-finance-millionaires.html)". That was rebutted today in Forbes, by Betsy Brill (President of Strategic Philanthropy) in " [Nonprofit CEOs Are Worth Every Dime](http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/21/brill-salary-ceo-philanthropy-intelligent-investing-nonprofit.html)": > TheÂ _Chronicle _survey only reflects data from the 325 highest funded nonprofit organizations, and thus represents only .02% of the 1.5 million registered nonprofits operating in the U.S. To suggest that the 30 some nonprofit executives (among them hospital CEOs, NCAA coaches and university presidents) who were paid more than $1 million in 2008 represent the irresponsible management and greed of an entire sector might be laughable if it weren't also potentially detrimental. By taking the survey data out of context, critics may cause donors to question--or even to pull back--their charitable giving at a time when nonprofits are struggling to meet an increased demand for services in the face of government cutbacks and dwindling private support.
Bell's criticism was published under "Philanthropy", Brill's response under "Intelligent Investing".
