I planning to shut down Brompt, which I previously wrote about in [2008](https://island94.org/2008/04/Brompt-is-a-blog-reminder.html), [2011](https://island94.org/2011/03/A-form-from-my-favorites.html), and [2022](https://island94.org/2022/09/reflections-on-brompt-2022):

Farewell ðŸ‘‹ Brompt is shutting down

I have some sad news to share: Iâ€™m planning to shut down this service, Brompt, at the end of the month (February, 2024).

Shutting down Brompt means that youâ€™ll no longer receive these automated reminders for your blog or writing. Iâ€™ve been running Brompt since 2008 and unfortunately, I havenâ€™t been able to make it sustainable. Youâ€™re one of about 80 people who are still using the service, though Iâ€™m never sure if you or anyone ever opens the emails regularly.

Regardless of Brompt shutting down, I hope youâ€™re doing well and Iâ€™d love to stay in touch. Send me an email at bensheldon@gmail.com or read my own blog at https://island94.org

All the best,

Ben (the person who made Brompt)
