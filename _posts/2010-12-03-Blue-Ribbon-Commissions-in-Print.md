I was annoyed by my [previous post](http://www.island94.org/2010/12/proposals-to-change-the-tax-deductibility-of-donations/) quoting the New York Times' usage of "blue ribbon panel" (and the numerous appeals to authority in that entire article) that I looked it up using Google Search's timeline: _[site:nytimes.com ["blue ribbon panel" OR "blue ribbon commission"]](http://www.google.com/search?tbs=tl:1&q=site:nytimes.com+[%22blue+ribbon+panel%22+OR+%22blue+ribbon+commission%22])._ There were 621 results.
