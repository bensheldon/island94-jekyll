Above is the signup form from [Brompt](http://brompt.com), the blog reminder service I built a few years ago for undisciplined bloggers like myself. I'm very proud of this form: it's clear, it contextualizes the data being requested within the functionality of the application, and it drives people to action.

There are a few areas for improvement: asking for your RSS feed rather than your blog's URL is a bit roundabout (autodetection is still in the feature parking lot) and it could use a little explanation at the top in case you bypassed the front page's explanation of the service.

Another reason I'm proud of this form is that it was built using Drupal's Forms API---and Drupal uses awful, unintuitive forms like they were going out of style.
