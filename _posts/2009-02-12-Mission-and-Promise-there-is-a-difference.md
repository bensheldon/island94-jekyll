I was forwarded this from [Angelina](http://alinapazwrites.blogspot.com/), who apparently read it on the side of her Starbucks cup (emphasis mine):

> "There is a subtle difference between a mission and a promise. A mission is something you strive to accomplish -- a promise is something you are compelled to keep. **One is individual, the other is shared.** When a mission and a promise are one and the same . . . that's when mountains are moved and races are won."

The last sentence is mostly pablum, but from yesterday's post about [dialogue and creating a shared community](http://www.island94.org/2009/02/online-fundraising-please-do-it-right/), I think it's important to think about not only what your own committment is, but also the expectations you are committing to with others.Â  In other words, a mission is a statement, a promise is a contract.
