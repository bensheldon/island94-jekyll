I listened to the TED talk of [Sir Ken Robinson](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html) on education from the [tweet of Chris Brogan](http://twitter.com/chrisbrogan/status/986668588).

The short quote:

>

> If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original.

But there is a lot more there about how the education system is built to get people into college as an end in and of itself.

Sir Robinson also mentioned Picasso's quote:

>

> Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.
