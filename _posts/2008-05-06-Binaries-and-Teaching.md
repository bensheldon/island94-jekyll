From an Ars Technica article entitled [YouTube University gets failing grade from prof, students](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080424-youtube-university-gets-failing-grade-from-prof-students.html). The [original analysis is here](http://www.oculture.com/2008/04/teaching_on_youtube.html)

> Juhasz breaks the issues down into a set of what she refers to as "binaries"â€”tensions between opposites that have to be balanced for proper teaching.

Those binaries were:

1. Public/Private
2. Aural/Visual
3. Body/Digital
4. Amateur/Expert
5. Entertainment/Education
6. Control/Chaos
