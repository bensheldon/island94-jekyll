In conversation with a friend, he mentioned his dream for a "No Website" Movement: content should be freed for consumption in whatever format its consumer desires.

This is not a website; it's a scrapbook, a swipe file and a memory hole. There is no separation between content and design, form or function: all is one. Island 94 looks like a blog insofar as this is the necessary form for its proper function: a legitimating feature and rhetorical device.

Rhetoric is the issue: just as curriculum requires an instructor, information requires delivery. The worst textbooks have always been readers: excerpts disconnected from their authors' greater work and padded with soft introductions.

I admit weakness in the face of emancipated content---I love my RSS reader and happily feed the beast---but that is only vane productivity. Enlightenment, if it is to be found on the web, shall come from unity, not incoherence.
