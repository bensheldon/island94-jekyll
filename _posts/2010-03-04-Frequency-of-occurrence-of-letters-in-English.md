I've already posted the [cake recipe](http://www.island94.org/2008/10/popco-cake-recipe/) from _PopCo_---a great novel by Alice Butler---so here another part of the back matter: a table of the frequency of occurrence of letters in English from Fletcher Pratt's S_ecret and Urgent: the story of codes and ciphers_, Blue Ribbon Books, 1939. To be fair, the table above is actually from the only place I could find it on the internet: a 1997 patent for a [chordic keyboard](http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=WDsaAAAAEBAJ) who cites "Pratt Fetcher". [Fletcher Pratt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher_Pratt) also established a dining club upon which Asimov's _Black Widowers_ series was based. **Update**: Apparently the numbers above are different than what was published in _PopCo:_ ![](/uploads/2010-03-04-Frequency-of-occurrence-of-letters-in-English/popco-frequency-of-letters-in-english.png "popco-frequency of letters in english")
