From a Wall Street Journal article on [Congressional expense accounts](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124381530535870685.html):

> Summaries of such lawmaker expenses are available to the public in print, either by mail or in volumes that can be viewed in basement rooms on Capitol Hill. The House's quarterly reports -- which run over 3,000 pages apiece, across multiple volumes -- are stored in a cupboard in a windowless office near a shoeshine stand.

It's a piss-poor device when you _actually_ think about it: why would you need storage to have windows (it's probably better for the books to not have sunlight)? and who cares if it's near a shoeshine stand (other than the associations with race and class, of course)? This is the equivalent of an ad hominem attack, but for an inaniment object.
