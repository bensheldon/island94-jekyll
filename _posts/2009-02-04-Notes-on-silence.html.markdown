My roommate (a teacher) left open this week's _Newsweek_ with a movie review of the French film, _ [The Class](http://www.newsweek.com/id/182529),_ that began with this quote, tattooed on one of the students and dubiously attributed to the Qu'ran:

>

> If your words are less important than silence, keep quiet.

Which sounds suspiciously similar to the Buddhist quote:

>

> Do not speak---unless it improves on _silence_

Trying to google through Christian quotations, I found little in the way of direct quotations, though lots of [interpretation](http://www.therealpresence.org/chapel/howtoflw.htm). 

As a contemporary quote, I like [Cloud Cult](http://www.cloudcult.com/)'s "The Deaf Girls Song", off of _ [The Meaning of 8](http://www.amazon.com/Meaning-8-Cloud-Cult/dp/B000NQR7RK)_:

>

> Did you hear about the deaf girl
The one whose song's gone number one
Three minutes of silence on the radio
It's the best damn gift for everyone
