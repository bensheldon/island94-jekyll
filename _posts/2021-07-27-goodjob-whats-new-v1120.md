This is a quick roundup of what’s new with GoodJob v1.12.0 since the last update published for [GoodJob v1.9](https://island94.org/2021/01/goodjob-1-4-jruby-compatibility-and-more).

GoodJob ( [github](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job) ) is a multithreaded, Postgres-based, ActiveJob backend for Ruby on Rails. If you’re new to GoodJob, read the  [introductory blog post](https://island94.org/2020/07/introducing-goodjob-1-0).

_For further details on the following updates, check out GoodJob's [Changelog](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) or [Readme](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/blob/main/README.md)._

### Cron-like replacement for repeating/recurring jobs

GoodJob now ships with a [cron-like replacement for repeating/recurring jobs](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job#cron-style-repeatingrecurring-jobs). The cron-like process runs either via the CLI, or `async` within the web server process. Repeating jobs can be scheduled to the second, powered by the [Fugit](https://github.com/floraison/fugit) gem. Here’s what the configuration looks like:

```ruby
# config/environments/application.rb or a specific environment e.g. production.rb

# Enable cron in this process; e.g. only run on the first Heroku worker process
config.good_job.enable_cron = ENV['DYNO'] == 'worker.1' # or `true` or via $GOOD_JOB_ENABLE_CRON

# Configure cron with a hash that has a unique key for each recurring job
config.good_job.cron = {
  # Every 15 minutes, enqueue `ExampleJob.set(priority: -10).perform_later(52, name: "Alice")`
  frequent_task: { # each recurring job must have a unique key
    cron: "*/15 * * * *", # cron-style scheduling format by fugit gem
    class: "ExampleJob", # reference the Job class with a string
    args: [42, { name: "Alice" }], # arguments to pass; can also be a proc e.g. `-> { { when: Time.now } }`
    set: { priority: -10 }, # additional ActiveJob properties; can also be a lambda/proc e.g. `-> { { priority: [1,2].sample } }`
    description: "Something helpful", # optional description that appears in Dashboard (coming soon!)
  },
  another_task: {
    cron: "0 0,12 * * *",
    class: "AnotherJob",
  },
  # etc.
}
```

### Concurrency controls

GoodJob now offers an [ActiveJob extension](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job#activejob-concurrency) to provide customizable limits on the number of jobs enqueued or executed concurrently. Rails might upstream it too. Here's how to configure it:

```ruby
# app/jobs/my_job.rb
class MyJob < ApplicationJob
  include GoodJob::ActiveJobExtensions::Concurrency

  good_job_control_concurrency_with(
    # Maximum number of jobs with the concurrency key to be concurrently enqueued
    enqueue_limit: 2,

    # Maximum number of jobs with the concurrency key to be concurrently performed
    perform_limit: 1,

    # A unique key to be globally locked against.
    # Can be String or Lambda/Proc that is invoked in the context of the job.
    # Note: Arguments passed to #perform_later must be accessed through `arguments` method.
    key: -> { "Unique-#{arguments.first}" } #  MyJob.perform_later("Alice") => "Unique-Alice"
  )

  def perform(first_name)
    # do work
  end
end
```

### Dashboard Demo

Don't take my word for what a good job it is. Check out the new GoodJob Dashboard demo running on Heroku entirely within a single free dyno: https://goodjob-demo.herokuapp.com/
