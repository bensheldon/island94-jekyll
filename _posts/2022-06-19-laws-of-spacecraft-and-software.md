Lots of similarities between [Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design](https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html) and software management; via AJ's weekly email:

<blockquote markdown="1">

8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.

15. (Shea's Law) The ability to improve a design occurs primarily at the interfaces. This is also the prime location for screwing it up.

20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.

38. Capabilities drive requirements, regardless of what the systems engineering textbooks say.

40. (McBryan's Law) You can't make it better until you make it work.

42. If there's not a flight program, there's no money.
      If there is a flight program, there's no time.
