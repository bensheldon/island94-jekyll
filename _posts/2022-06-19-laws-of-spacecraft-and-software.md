Lots of similarities between [Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design](https://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/akins_laws.html) and software management:

<blockquote markdown="1">

8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.

15. (Shea's Law) The ability to improve a design occurs primarily at the interfaces. This is also the prime location for screwing it up.

20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.

38. Capabilities drive requirements, regardless of what the systems engineering textbooks say.

42. If there's not a flight program, there's no money.
      If there is a flight program, there's no time.
