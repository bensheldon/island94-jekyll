This wonderful rhetoric is in regards to beginning to charge annual fees and remove grace periods from people who regularly pay off their credit cards (from the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/business/19credit.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all)). In other words, _consistent_ revenue from transaction fees is not the near-term windfall quick-buck, pump and dump shareholders demand. (Yeah, my rhetoric is rusty.)
