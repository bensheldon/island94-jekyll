Peter Klausler's ["Principles of the American Cargo Cult"](http://klausler.com/cargo.html) is one of my favorite statements (even more when applied to the idea of "best practices").

> **II. Causality is selectable**
>
> **All interconnection is apparent**
>
> **Otherwise, complicated explanations would be necessary.**
>
> **The end supports the explanation of the means**
>
> **A successful person's explanation of the means of his success is highly credible by the very fact of his success.**
>
> **You can succeed by emulating the purported behavior of successful people**
>
> This is the key to the cargo cult. To enjoy the success of another, just mimic the rituals he claims to follow.
>
> Your idol gets the blame if things don't work out, not you.
>
> **You have a right to your share**
>
> You get to define your share.
>
> Your share is the least you will accept without crying injustice.
>
> Celebrate getting more than your share.
