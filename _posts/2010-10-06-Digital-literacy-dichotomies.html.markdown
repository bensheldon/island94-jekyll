I posted this to the Digital Inclusion Network listserv. It's a synthesis of the spectrum of approaches I've seen (and contributed to ---you can probably figure out which end of the spectrum I'm on) in the BTOP, and now post-BTOP, media field.

>

> 1. What is Digital Literacy? There are several different conceptions, from a task-based approach similar to computer literacy, to a skills/critical-analysis approach more similar to media literacy, and many in between.

>

> 2. What is Digital Literacy training? Is it a pre-defined curriculum or a set of learning objectives to be developed locally?

>

> 3. What is the role of community based organizations (CBOs)? Are they spaces for training, or are they active hubs and facilitators? Are we building their capacity to offer digital literacy training, or are we building their capacity to remain strong and relevant beyond the broadband push?

>

> 4. What is our vision for healthy, broadband-enabled communities? Is it evolutionary (faster, more competitive consumers) or revolutionary (sustainable, cooperative, engaged citizens).
