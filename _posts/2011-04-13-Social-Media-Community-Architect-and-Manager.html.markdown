Exploring the recesses of my email I came across some bad ideas I gave to a good friend, neighbor and excellent "Social Media Community Architect and Manager" as we were exploring possible resume headers for him:

> If I were to take the best amalgamation of words, I would go with "Social Media Community Architect and Manager"---which is somewhat awkward. I think you want the words:

>

>

1. social (which is the buzzword of online social networking);

>

2. community (which is both online and offline and has a certain fuzziness to it); and

>

3. something that describes the process of creation... and management.

>

> I would shy clear of the word technology... "media" definitely has more hotness right now. Maybe "Social Media and Community Architect".

>

> What about "Social Media and Community Entrepreneur" (everyone loves an Entrepreneur and I would say you qualify more than anyone I know... though it is somewhat heartless)

>

> I went through my contacts on LinkedIn and picked out some words/phrases they use to describe themselves:

>

>

- Community Technologist

>

- Online Community Manager

>

- strategic planning for your online social network initiatives

>

- Building and Executing Social Media Business Strategy

>

- Rich Media Developer

>

- Interactive Marketing Executive

>

- Technology Coordinator

>

- Community Architect

>

- community & communications coordinator

>

- New Media

>

- hybrid social media

>

- collaboration technology

>

- listening technology

>

- Emerging

>

- Link Development

>

- Interactive

>

>

I think he went with something sensible like "Community Alchemist".
