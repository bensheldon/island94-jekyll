My roommate [Dean](http://notthemessiah.net) created this video about some peculiarities in our store bought eggs:

Now I'm not sure what these guy's are doing with their chickens, but frankly the result is a little freaky. With a name like "Lally Farms," I think anyone would be suspicious.

I made some tacos tonight (eggs, grated carrot and some sliced red pepper on top) and was greeted to the doubly-yolked surprise. Though honestly, the surprise has worn off since this has been going on for weeks with multiple cartons of eggs. Now it's just foreboding.
