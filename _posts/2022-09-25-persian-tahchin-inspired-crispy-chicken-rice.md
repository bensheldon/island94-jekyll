This is a [Milk Street recipe](https://www.177milkstreet.com/recipes/persian-style-baked-saffron-rice-chicken), but because I detest their instructional design, I redesigned it here.  I like it because:

- It can be made with ingredients from Trader Joes.
- It has currants.
- It's resilient; the second time I made it with indirect heat on a propane bbq grill because my oven was on the fritz. Still great. Also I've tried brown basmati rice, tried doubling the eggs, never measure very well. Still great.
- Crispy, buttery starch is great.

### Ingredients 

* 1.5 cups basmati rice
* 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
* 2 tablespoons boiling water
* 12 ounces boneless skinless chicken thies
* 1 lemon, for juice and zest
* 2 garlic cloves
* 0.5 cups whole milk greek yogurt
* 1 large egg (yolk only)
* 3 tablespoons dried currants
* 2 tablespoons salted butter, melted
* Parsley, to garnish
* Roasted Pistachios, to garnish
* Olive oil
* Salt and pepper

**A pie plate.** Milk Street spends a paragraph saying why glass is best (you can see the browning), but I've been doing ceramic and it's fine.

### 30 minutes to 12 hours ahead

**Soak the rice.** Place the rice in a bowl with enough water to cover by 1 inch and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 12 hours. Drain and rinse the rice again.

### To begin

- **Place the oven rack at lowest position** and **preheat the oven to 400 degrees** 
- **Prepare a large pot of salted boiling water** to cook the rice.
- Thoroughly **oil your pie plate**.
-
### Prep the ingredients

- **Melt the butter** and set aside.
- **Crumble the saffron threads** and **soak the saffron in 2 tablespoons of boiling water** in a small bowl. Set aside.
- '**Zest the lemon** resulting in about 3 teaspoons of lemon zest, to be divided between the chicken and the yogurt sauce. Put the rest of the lemon aside to be wedged later.
- **Grate the garlic**
- **Trim the chicken thighs** into 1 to 1.5 inch pieces and in a medium bowl **combine the chicken with 1 tbsp of oil, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, and garlic** Salt and pepper it.
- **Separate the egg yolk** (discard the white) and  **mix the egg yolk, yogurt, remaining 2 teaspoons of lemon zest, and saffron water** in a bowl large enough to eventually hold the rice too. Salt and pepper it. Whisk to combine well.

### Cooking

- **Add the rice to the pot of salted boiling water** and cook for 5 minutes until par-boiled; the rice will still be slightly crunchy.  Drain the rice.
- **Mix the par-boiled rice with the yogurt mixture** and stir to combine.
- Add about **1/3 of the rice mixture to the bottom of the pie plate,** pressing it into an even layer on the bottom and halfway up the sides.
- **Mix the currants and the yogurt-chicken mixture into the remaining rice and yogurt mixture** and then **transfer the mixture to the pie dish.** Do not compact or press the rice, but do distribute it evenly. 
- **Drizzle the melted butter over the rice mixture.**
- **Tightly cover the pie dish with foil** and **bake for 1 hour covered.**

### While it bakes, clean up and prepare

- **Chop the parsley** and reserve for serving.
- **Chop the pistachios** and reserve for serving.
- **Slice the lemon** into wedges for personal squeezing. 

### After baking for 1 hour

- **Remove the foil** and then uncovered, **bake for an additional 10 minutes** until the bottom is golden brown.
- Remove from the oven and **rest for about 5 minutes**.
-  Run a knife or spatula around the edge to loosen the rice from the pie plate, then **invert onto a serving plate**.
- **Sprinkle with the parsley and pistachios** and serve with the **lemon wedges on the side**.
