    <ul>
  <li>One of my coworkers said this week “You’ve been an engineering director and in leadership before, right? I appreciate your perspective; any advice and resources you’d recommend?” So that set my mind racing. I dunno. On one hand, it’s like, well, first, you grind out 10 years of 1-year of experience 10 times, but do it <a href="https://transmissionproject.org/projects.html">50 times a year</a>.  On the other, <a href="https://medium.com/@livlab/dont-work-with-psychopaths-b1a848914455">keep a delta file</a> and I also think about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/566213">Secrets of Consulting</a> quite a lot (content warning: I haven’t re-read it in a long time; I tried reading the same author’s <em>The Psychology of Computer Programming</em> more recently and couldn’t do it).</li>
  <li>Work otherwise is in the final marathon of promo packets and performance reviews and quarterly planning and a reorg and oh, the next version of Ruby is released in 3 weeks and it’s go time. Then we do it all again. I love my team so much.</li>
  <li>I finished reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/305076-the-final-architecture">The Final Architecture</a> series. I didn’t enjoy it as much as Children of Time (“the octopus books”). After reading all the Gateway books and 3-body problem books, I’m a bit over the idea that there’s a malicious (or at least self-interested) group of people who are unhappy with the current value of the Planck constant <em>and are doing something about it</em>. I was into the subplot of alien criminality.</li>
  <li>
    <p>I finished Talos Principle 2, but I screwed up the golden gates thing, so I have to beat it again just to get the special special ending. I’ve been playing it in parallel with a friend and appreciate our back and forth:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Me: I’m personally more worried about environmental catastrophe than AI, but i guess they’re intertwined. Material conditions that are unfit for life. Like some of the talos robots seem to touch on my philosophical question which is like: how do we maximize individual agency+satisfaction while also avoiding collective/systemic fucking-around-and-finding-out.</p>

      <p>Friend: we can see from the game the answer lies somewhere on the spectrum between having 1000 robits around a crumbling power source vs having a magic 3D printing pyramid for use to conquer the stars</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I also started playing Talos 1 and it’s much less chill than the 2nd game. I may not finish it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For GoodJob, all of the things I want have been labeled <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">“Help Wanted”</a>. I do want to get the row-locking foundations in place myself, though I think the safe upgrade path for it might take a little while to straighten out. I think I have finally <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/discussions/831#discussioncomment-7283545">mastered advisory locks</a>, so, of course, that means change it all up.</li>
  <li>I ran <code>bundle update</code> on Day of the Shirt, which means I also upgraded to Shakapacker, which means that I have, once again, spent an entire weekend fumbling with Webpack configuration to get <code>window.$</code> working. I also got a nice email from the owner of a t-shirt website that validated my <a href="https://dayoftheshirt.com/news/state-of-the-shirt-2020">thesis</a> that no one visits websites anymore, let alone to buy t-shirts: the website owner got a (different) full-time job.</li>
