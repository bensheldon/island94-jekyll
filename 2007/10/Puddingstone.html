    <p>I happen to be particularly fond of Puddingstone, the conglomerate rock found around Boston. It’s also the official rock of Massachusetts; specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxbury_puddingstone">Roxbury Puddingstone</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a nifty looking rock, or rather a collection of different rocks within a sedimentary rock.</p>

<p>It also has some fantastical elements:</p>

<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a poem entitled <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/eldritch/owh/pudding.html">The Dorchester Giant</a> that describes Boston’s puddingstone being the result of the abandoned children of a giant flinging plum pudding about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are those lone ones doing now,</p>

  <p>The wife and the children sad?</p>

  <p>Oh, they are in a terrible rout,</p>

  <p>Screaming, and throwing their pudding about,</p>

  <p>Acting as they were mad.</p>

  <p>They flung it over to Roxbury hills,</p>

  <p>They flung it over the plain,</p>

  <p>And all over Milton and Dorchester too</p>

  <p>Great lumps of pudding the giants threw;</p>

  <p>They tumbled as thick as rain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Puddingstone is also to be imbued with magical and protective powers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_puddingstone">Herfordshire Puddingstone</a> was used to cover the top of witch’s coffin to prevent her to escape in death.</p>

<p>**Update: **Here’s the whole poem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>**The Dorchester Giant</p>

  <p>By Oliver Wendell Holmes (1830)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>**</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a giant in time of old,</p>

  <p>A mighty one was he;</p>

  <p>He had a wife, but she was a scold,</p>

  <p>So he kept her shut in his mammoth fold;</p>

  <p>And he had children three.</p>

  <p>It happened to be an election day,</p>

  <p>And the giants were choosing a king;</p>

  <p>The people were not democrats then,</p>

  <p>They did not talk of the rights of men,</p>

  <p>And all that sort of thing.</p>

  <p>Then the giant took his children three,</p>

  <p>And fastened them in the pen;</p>

  <p>The children roared; quoth the giant, “Be still!”</p>

  <p>And Dorchester Heights and Milton Hill</p>

  <p>Rolled back the sound again.</p>

  <p>Then he brought them a pudding stuffed with plums,</p>

  <p>As big as the State-House dome;</p>

  <p>Quoth he, “There’s something for you to eat;</p>

  <p>So stop your mouths with your ‘lection treat,</p>

  <p>And wait till your dad comes home.”</p>

  <p>So the giant pulled him a chestnut stout,</p>

  <p>And whittled the boughs away;</p>

  <p>The boys and their mother set up a shout.</p>

  <p>Said he, “You’re in, and you can’t get out,</p>

  <p>Bellow as loud as you may.”</p>

  <p>Off he went, and he growled a tune</p>

  <p>As he strode the fields along</p>

  <p>‘Tis said a buffalo fainted away,</p>

  <p>And fell as cold as a lump of clay,</p>

  <p>When he heard the giant’s song.</p>

  <p>But whether the story’s true or not,</p>

  <p>It isn’t for me to show;</p>

  <p>There’s many a thing that’s twice as queer</p>

  <p>In somebody’s lectures that we hear,</p>

  <p>And those are true, you know.</p>

  <p>. . . . . .</p>

  <p>What are those lone ones doing now,</p>

  <p>The wife and the children sad?</p>

  <p>Oh, they are in a terrible rout,</p>

  <p>Screaming, and throwing their pudding about,</p>

  <p>Acting as they were mad.</p>

  <p>They flung it over to Roxbury hills,</p>

  <p>They flung it over the plain,</p>

  <p>And all over Milton and Dorchester too</p>

  <p>Great lumps of pudding the giants threw;</p>

  <p>They tumbled as thick as rain.</p>

  <p>. . . . .</p>

  <p>Giant and mammoth have passed away,</p>

  <p>For ages have floated by;</p>

  <p>The suet is hard as a marrow-bone,</p>

  <p>And every plum is turned to a stone,</p>

  <p>But there the puddings lie.</p>

  <p>And if, some pleasant afternoon,</p>

  <p>You’ll ask me out to ride,</p>

  <p>The whole of the story I will tell,</p>

  <p>And you shall see where the puddings fell,</p>

  <p>And pay for the punch beside.</p>
