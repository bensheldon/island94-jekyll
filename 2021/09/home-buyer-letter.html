    <p>Having now successfully purchased a home in San Francisco, I have had friends asked me for resources. This was the letter we sent to the seller, which is <em>very</em> SF, but also the energy to bring. I also learned that these letters are waning because they are biased af.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Dear [seller],</p>

  <p>Your home at [street address] is the right fit for us, our two cats, and (hopefully) our future family. We love the long layout, high ceilings (we’re both tall) and sunny patio, and look forward to hosting friends for Sunday brunch someday.</p>

  <p>We’re rooted in the city through the South End Rowing Club, St. Francis Lutheran Church, supporting the YMCA, kickstarting local businesses like Andytown coffee, and working at tech companies and nonprofits. Ben worked for three years just around the corner at California and Grant, and Angelina has worked at numerous tech companies around Union Square and SOMA. We love the quiet contrast of Nob Hill against the rest of downtown San Francisco.</p>

  <p>We see SF as a long term home and [street address] as a homebase for work and play: swimming and rowing on the SF Bay, and wine trips up to Napa and Sonoma too. Your home would have the perfect commute for Ben, walking down the hill to his nonprofit job at [organization] where he builds technology to help people apply for food stamps, remove marijuana convictions from criminal records, and improve how government delivers services to those who need them most. And it’s a short walk for Angelina to the [company] Shuttle or Downtown SF [company] office where she does business development for maps and location technology in use around the world.</p>

  <p>Your home would provide the greatest fit for us as we aim to continue to contribute to the fabric of the city, where we hope to raise a family and be active in the community. We aim to take great care of an already-loved property while advocating for a neighborhood that supports all members throughout the growth of our city.</p>

  <p>Our offer is fair given the condition, amenities and comparable sales, and we aim for being the best buyer to steward this home and the neighborhood. We look forward to your consideration of our offer for [street address].</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br />
Ben and Angelina</p>
