Last week I completed a 2 day [Technology of Participation](http://www.ica-usa.org/index.php?pr=whatistop) Facilitator training. Developed by the [Institute of Cultural Affairs](http://www.ica-usa.org/index.php), the Technology of Participation is a series of practices and principles for leading groups through inclusive and participatory dialogues and planning. The training was led by [Nancy Jackson](http://www.gammybird.com/) and [Ruth-Ann Rasbold](http://www.donahue.umassp.edu/services/earlyed/headstart/staff), who were excellent.

One of my first questions in the training was the ethical/political dimension to leading participatory methods (after an early morning drive to New Hampshire, I was feeling punchy). Here are the circumstances when participation doesn't work (from the facilitator handbook):

> - there is no intention of using the information gathered, the plans made, or the excitement generated when people become involved.
> - people are attached to a particular outcome.
> - truth telling is not an accepted norm in an organization.
> - people are so busy, they are unwilling to set aside the time needed to engage in participatory processes or follow through on their collective decisions.
> - there is no apparent need to do things differently
> - the leader does not champion participation
> - people want a quick ﬁx to a deep problem
> - participation is performed around a non-issue or merely a surface issue—that is, when the focus is to "straighten something out."

> _from Participation Works: Business Cases from Around the World, James P. Troxel (ed.) with the Institute of Cultural Affairs, Alexandria,Virginia, Miles River Press, 1993, p. 28._

I participated in the facilitator training both because of my enjoyment in facilitating small groups---and my desire to improve my methods and confidence for facilitating larger groups---and that my boss is also trained in the Technology of Participation and I've quite enjoyed being a participant in the use of these methods.
