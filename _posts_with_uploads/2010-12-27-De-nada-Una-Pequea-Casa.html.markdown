My former-roommate Alex (the guy in the middle) is spending his winter vacation in Mexico volunteering with [One Small House](http://www.onesmallhouse.org/). I donated to the project and they've been awesome in thanking me. > During the week of December 26-31, 2010, a group of volunteers from the United States will work with the community of Lazaro Cardenas to build them a new, free health clinic. Currently, this small community is receiving its health services from a trailer that is inadequate to handle their needs. With the support of donations, One Small House and its volunteers will help ensure that this community receives the quality health care it needs.
