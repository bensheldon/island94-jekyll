Havard Business Review's Dan Pallota [quoted from Julia Moulden's book, _RIPE: Rich, Rewarding Work After 50_](http://blogs.hbr.org/pallotta/2011/01/the-wisdom-years-the-value-of.html): >
- I can tell the difference between a customer who has a legitimate gripe with my company and one who is an alcoholic or has anger-management issues. At 25, I thought it was all and always about me.
- My bullshit meter is highly attuned because I've heard a lot of bullshit. At 25 I was naive enough to believe most of what everyone was dishing out.
- I have the confidence to know that if I don't understand some new business idea you're pitching to me it's not because I'm stupid. It's because you're not communicating it well. At 25 I was more prone to point the finger inward.
- I know that business construction projects cost about twice what you budgeted them to cost. At 25, I was continually shocked and unprepared when costly problems popped up or snags set projects back months.
- I know that being nice to people and being a good leader are two different things. At 25 I was nice to everyone. And not the best leader.

I suggested in the [comments](http://blogs.hbr.org/pallotta/2011/01/the-wisdom-years-the-value-of.html#comment-132959702) this addition: > My peers and I outnumber everyone else. At 25, people over 50 were few and far between which let me do a lot without someone looking over my shoulder and judging my work.
Which is really a [defining difference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss_and_Howe) between Boomers and Millennials: Millennials are coming of age with a lot more older people around then when Boomers came of age. But I've also disagreed with Dan Pallota [before](http://www.island94.org/2009/10/social-work-is-womens-work-so-we-dont-care/). The population pyramid image is from [here](http://www.flatrock.org.nz/topics/money_politics_law/boom_moves_along.htm), which looks like it may have been copied out of a newspaper.
