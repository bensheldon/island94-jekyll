[ ![](2010-06-23-Task-identification-and-completion/task-identification-and-completion.png "task identification and completion") ](2010-06-23-Task-identification-and-completion/task-identification-and-completion.png)Where do your strengths lie? I'd put myself in the upper half rather than the lower: I'm better at Task Identification than Task Completion. And by "completion", I mean 1 of the 3 Ds: Do, Delegate or Dump.
