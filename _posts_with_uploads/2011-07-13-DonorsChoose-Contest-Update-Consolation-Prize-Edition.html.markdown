DonorsChoose announced the [winners for their Hacking Education contest](http://www.donorschoose.org/hacking-education-winners) today and unfortunately [Print & Share](http://printandshare.com), the app I developed with my coworker Billy, didn't win. The consolation prize is all of the positive feedback I've received from teachers who are using Print & Share:

- a Wordpress plugin, and TwitterAPI app that use geographic location to suggest DonorsChoose projects,

- an email signature generator that suggests projects based on the projects' funding needs

- a browser extension that suggests DonorsChoose projects when you search Amazon.com

The one winner I do like sends [automated press-releases](http://dc2jpr.appspot.com/) to local news outlets. The content of the release isn't much to work with (though Print & Share shares that problem), but it could be an effective news peg for general school issues (not that "Local schools must turn to the internet because of waste/fraud/abuse" is the story I'd want to see run).

My criticism of those automated referral tools is that they all require an advocate to install the tool---but that advocate has little control over the projects they refer people to. In other words, these winners require someone to really care about DonorsChoose as a whole, not necessarily any specific project. Do those individuals exist, en masse? I've learned there is a big network of teachers who promote eachother's DonorsChoose projects, but since they can't specifically suggest a friend or colleague's project, will they adopt the winning tools? It's the sizzle of social networking without the (tofu-) steak .

The fact that these tools seem in search of an audience is what disappoints me most. As attributed to thinker Seth Godin by  [Richard Millington](http://www.feverbee.com/2011/07/startups.html): "Find products for your audience, not audiences for your products." We built Print & Share as a tool for teachers to better promote their own projects---because teachers are the audience that cares most about their projects' success-- which is why the tweet I just received while writing this post cracks me up:
