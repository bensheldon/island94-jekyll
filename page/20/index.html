    <p>From the Leonard Mlodinow’s <em>The Drunkard’s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Going against the law of small numbers requires character. For while anyone can sit back and point to the bottom line as justiﬁcation, assessing instead a person’s actual knowledge and actual ability takes conﬁdence, thought. good judgment, and, well, guts. You can’t just stand up in a meeting with your colleagues and yell, “Don’t ﬁre her. She was just on the wrong end of a Bernoulli series.” Nor is it likely to win you friends if you stand up and say of the gloating fellow who just sold more Toyota Camiys than anyone else in the history of the dealership. “It was just a random ﬂuctuation.” And so it rarely happens. Executives’ winning years are attributed to their brilliance, explained retroactively through incisive hindsight. And when people don’t succeed, we often assume the failure accurately reﬂects the proportion with which their talents and their abilities ﬁll the urn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The law of small numbers, in context of the quote here, says that people believe that a <em>small</em> sampling of a large urn of different-colored balls will be representative of the proportions of colored balls as a whole. This is not the true, but people are biased to believe it. This is compared to the Law of Large Numbers, which says that if you make a <em>large</em> continuous sampling, it will eventually limit towards the true proportion—which is true, but large is large.</p>

    <p>Wikipedia on  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing">satisficing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Satisficing</strong> (a portmanteau of satisfy and suffice) is a decision-making strategy that attempts to meet criteria for adequacy, rather than to identify an optimal solution. A satisficing strategy may often be (near) optimal if the costs of the decision-making process itself, such as the cost of obtaining complete information, are considered in the outcome calculus.</p>

  <p>…The word satisfice was coined by Herbert Simon. He pointed out that human beings lack the cognitive resources to maximize: we usually do not know the relevant probabilities of outcomes, we can rarely evaluate all outcomes with sufficient precision, and our memories are weak and unreliable. A more realistic approach to rationality takes into account these limitations: This is called bounded rationality.</p>

  <p>…Satisficing occurs in consensus building when the group looks towards a solution everyone can agree on even if it may not be the best.</p>

  <p>Example: A group spends hours projecting the next fiscal year’s budget. After hours of debating they eventually reach a consensus, only to have one person speak up and ask if the projections are correct. When the group becomes upset at the question, it is not because this person is wrong to ask, but rather because they have come up with a solution that works. The projection may not be what will actually come, but the majority agrees on one number and thus the projection is good enough to close the book on the budget.</p>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy’s primary run in West Virginia, where a large focus of his time was spent responding to fears over his Catholicism. This is from remarks titled “ <a href="http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/JFK+Pre-Pres/1960/002PREPRES12SPEECHES_60APR21.htm">The Religion Issue in American Politics</a>” that JFK made at the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Washington, DC, April 21, 1960:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What, then, is the so-called religious issue in American politics today? It is not, it seems to me, my actual religious convictions - but a misunderstanding of what those convictions actually are. It is not the actual existence of religious voting blocs - but a suspicion that such voting blocs may exist. And when we deal with such public fears and suspicions, the American press has a very grave responsibility.</p>

  <p>I know the press did not create this religious issue. My religious affiliation is a fact - religious intolerance is a fact. And the proper role of the press is to report all facts that are a matter of public interest.</p>

  <p>But the press has a responsibility, I think you will agree, which goes far beyond a reporting of the facts. It goes beyond lofty editorials deploring intolerance. For my religion is hardly, in this critical year of 1960, the dominant issue of our time. It is hardly the most important criterion - or even a relevant criterion - on which the American people should make their choice for Chief Executive. And the press, while not creating the issue, will largely determine whether or not it does become dominant - whether it is kept in perspective - whether it is considered objectively - whether needless fears and suspicions are stilled instead of aroused.</p>

  <p>The members of the press should report the facts as they find them. They should describe the issues as they see them. But they should beware, it seems to me, of either magnifying this issue or oversimplifying it. They should beware of ignoring the vital issues of this campaign, while filling their pages with analyses that cannot be proven, with statements that cannot be documented and with emphasis which cannot be justified.</p>

  <p>I spoke in Wisconsin, for example, on farm legislation, foreign policy, defense, civil rights and several dozen other issues. The people of Wisconsin seemed genuinely interested in these addresses. But I rarely found them reported in the press - except when they were occasionally sandwiched in between descriptions of my hand-shaking, my theme-song, family haircut, and inevitably, my religion.</p>

  <p>At almost every stop in Wisconsin I invited questions - and the questions came - on price supports, labor unions, disengagement, taxes and inflation. But there sessions were rarely reported in the press except when one topic was discussed: religion. One article, for example, supposedly summing the primary up in advance, mentioned the word Catholic 20 times in 15 paragraphs - not mentioning even once dairy farms, disarmament, labor legislation or any other issue. And on the Sunday before the Primary, the Milwaukee Journal featured a map of the state, listing county by county the relative strength of three types of voters - Democrats, Republicans and Catholics.</p>

  <p>In West Virginia, it is the same story. As reported in yesterday’s Washington Post, the great bulk of West Virginians paid very little attention to my religion - until they read repeatedly in the nation’s press that this was the decisive issue in West Virginia. There are many serious problems in that state - problems big enough to dominate any campaign - but religion is not one of them.</p>

  <p>I do not think that religion is the decisive issue in any state. I do not think it should be. I do not think it should be made to be. And recognizing my own responsibilities in that regard, I am hopeful that you will recognize yours also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds so timely—especially if you substitute religion for whatever (e.g. race). And considering these remarks were made 50 years ago, does that mean we can’t blame bad journalism for the downfall of news?</p>

    <p>Again from Marianne M. Jennings’ <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Signs-Ethical-Collapse-Companies/dp/0312354304">The Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse: How to Spot Moral Meltdowns in Companies… Before It’s Too Late</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some years ago a former dean asked me to look into a new way of teaching students business ethics. He wanted to stop sending our students over to the philosophy department for their ethics training. His reasoning was that “they go over there, find out capitalism is a tool of the devil, and then switch majors.” His theory had one more part to it. Those who did not switch majors and returned to study business came back with a guilt complex. They assumed, based on the views of their philosophy professors, that they had already sold their souls to the devil, so what possible difference could a little cooking of the books mean in their eternal damnation? So, those who remained became comfortable with crossing ethical lines.</p>

  <p>Ethics instruction during the era in which the crop of officer felons was trained was not virtue ethics. Rather, these students were given a heavy dose of social responsibility and little or no discussion of the ethical issues in financial reporting. Their ethics instruction focused on these distinct areas:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Environmentalism</li>
    <li>Diversity</li>
    <li>Human rights</li>
    <li>Philanthropy</li>
    <li>Giving back to the community</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The ethics books and curriculum of this generation of business leaders (and regretfully, still today) deﬁne doing the right thing in these areas as ethics writ large. Moral relativists are hesitant to establish bright lines between right and wrong, except in areas they deem appropriate. These topics and guidelines for business ethics come directly from the AACSB accrediting body for business schools, which mandates the following content in the business-school curriculum if the school desires AACSB accreditation for its programs:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ethical and global issues</li>
    <li>The influence of political, social, legal and regulatory, environmental and technological issues</li>
    <li>The impact of demographic diversity on organizations</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Those trained under this pedagogical philosophy will order, “No sweat shops,” but could never bring themselves to say, “Always be honest.” They can condemn lumber companies for destroying the rain forests, but they would never suggest that corporate executives should control their conduct in their personal lives. To students trained in this era of business-ethics instruction, a demented sort of logic and attitude has resulted. As long as the company had a good record on community development and contribution, a little fraud was fine. They were not trained to ask the question “Does social conscience in some areas atone for the lack of moral conscience in finances and financial reporting?” Fannie Mae was named number one by Business Ethics magazine in its annual list of the most ethical companies in America in the same month that Fannie Mae’s multibillion-dollar accounting deception was unfolding. The CEO was forced out by his board because of questions about the firm’s financial reports even as the same group that created the parameters of ethical behavior in such a facile and arbitrary manner was honoring the company. True, few organizations have done more to help individuals get affordable housing than Fannie Mae. But recognition for a job well done does not justify misrepresentation in the marketplace.</p>

    <p>From Marianne M. Jennings’ <em>The Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse: How to Spot Moral Meltdowns in Companies… Before It’s Too Late</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sign #7: Goodness in some areas atones for evil in others</strong></p>

  <p>…Beware the socially responsible company. Watch out for the big donors. There is a certain con component in the Yeehaw Culture. The con men and women of the Yeehaw Culture have ﬁgured out a formula for drawing attention away from company performance and, in many cases, its ﬁnancials. Even without the Yeehaw Culture, this dedication to causes and charity seems to be a distraction from running the business. The result is not just a lack of focus, but also a diversion of funds that were needed for simple things, including, for example, the employees’ pensions. That distraction comes in the form of virtuous efforts in the community, charities, and all those social goals one can now ﬁnd on pretty much every company’s website. Stunningly, that information will be located on the investor-information home page. As cynical as it seems, skepticism about social responsibility and philanthropy may be one of the most certain determinants of a Yeehaw Culture. If you ﬁnd these present in a company, check for the other factors of ethical collapse because the generosity and service may be a cover in a troubled soul and even more troubled books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The term “yeehaw culture” comes from the Wyoming Law Reviews’ “Restoring Ethical Gumption in the Corporation: A Federalist Paper on Corporate Governance—Restoration of Active Virtue in the Corporate Structure to Curb the ‘Yeehaw Culture’ in Organizations”. It’s also the cry of Billy Crystal in <em>City Slickers</em>.</p>

<p>The book also encourages researching the community connections between management and charities.</p>

<p>Last week I completed a 2 day <a href="http://www.ica-usa.org/index.php?pr=whatistop">Technology of Participation</a> Facilitator training. Developed by the <a href="http://www.ica-usa.org/index.php">Institute of Cultural Affairs</a>, the Technology of Participation is a series of practices and principles for leading groups through inclusive and participatory dialogues and planning. The training was led by <a href="http://www.gammybird.com/">Nancy Jackson</a> and <a href="http://www.donahue.umassp.edu/services/earlyed/headstart/staff">Ruth-Ann Rasbold</a>, who were excellent.</p>

<p>One of my first questions in the training was the ethical/political dimension to leading participatory methods (after an early morning drive to New Hampshire, I was feeling punchy). Here are the circumstances when participation doesn’t work (from the facilitator handbook):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>there is no intention of using the information gathered, the plans made, or the excitement generated when people become involved.</li>
    <li>people are attached to a particular outcome.</li>
    <li>truth telling is not an accepted norm in an organization.</li>
    <li>people are so busy, they are unwilling to set aside the time needed to engage in participatory processes or follow through on their collective decisions.</li>
    <li>there is no apparent need to do things differently</li>
    <li>the leader does not champion participation</li>
    <li>people want a quick ﬁx to a deep problem</li>
    <li>participation is performed around a non-issue or merely a surface issue—that is, when the focus is to “straighten something out.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>from Participation Works: Business Cases from Around the World, James P. Troxel (ed.) with the Institute of Cultural Affairs, Alexandria,Virginia, Miles River Press, 1993, p. 28.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I participated in the facilitator training both because of my enjoyment in facilitating small groups—and my desire to improve my methods and confidence for facilitating larger groups—and that my boss is also trained in the Technology of Participation and I’ve quite enjoyed being a participant in the use of these methods.</p>

    <p>From the <a href="http://www.odnetwork.org/aboutod/principles.php">Organizational Development Network</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition of OD</strong></p>

  <p>Organization Development is a dynamic values-based approach to systems change in organizations and communities; it strives to build the capacity to achieve and sustain a new desired state that benefits the organization or community and the world around them.</p>

  <p><strong>Principles of Practice</strong></p>

  <p>The practice of OD is grounded in a distinctive set of core values and principles that guide behavior and actions.</p>

  <p><strong>Values-Based</strong></p>

  <p>The practice of OD is grounded in a distinctive set of core values and principles that guide behavior and actions. Values-Based Key Values include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respect and Inclusion</strong> – equitably values the perspective and opinions of everyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – builds collaborative relationships between the practitioner and the client while encouraging collaboration throughout the client system.</li>
    <li><strong>Authenticity</strong> – strives for authenticity and congruence and encourages these qualities in their clients</li>
    <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> – commits to developing self-awareness and interpersonal skills. OD practitioners engage in personal and professional development through lifelong learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Empowerment</strong> – focuses efforts on helping everyone in the client organization or community increase their autonomy and empowerment to levels that make the workplace and/or community satisfying and productive.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Supported by Theory</strong></p>

  <p>Draws from multiple disciplines that inform an understanding of human systems, including applied behavioral and physical sciences</p>

  <p><strong>Systems Focused</strong></p>

  <p>Approaches communities and organizations as open systems; that is, acts with the knowledge that change in one area of a system always results in changes in other areas; and change in one area cannot be sustained without supporting changes in other areas of the system.</p>

  <p><strong>Action Research</strong></p>

  <p>Continuously reexamines, reflects and integrates discoveries throughout the process of change in order to achieve desired outcomes. In this way, the client members are involved both in doing their work, and in dialogue about their reflection and learning in order to apply them to achieve shared results.</p>

  <p><strong>Process Focused</strong></p>

  <p>Intervenes in organizational or community processes to help bring about positive change and help the client work toward desired outcomes</p>

  <p><strong>Informed by Data</strong></p>

  <p>Involves proactive inquiry and assessment of the internal environment in order to discover and create a compelling need for change and the achievement of a desired future state of the organization or community. Some methods include survey feedback, assessment tools, interviewing, focus groups, story telling, process consultation and observation.</p>

  <p><strong>Client Centered</strong></p>

  <p>Focuses on the needs of the client in order to continually promote client ownership of all phases of the work and support the client’s ability to sustain change after the consultant engagement ends.</p>

  <p><strong>Focused on Effectiveness and Health</strong></p>

  <p>Helps to create and sustain a healthy effective human system as an interdependent part of its larger environment.</p>

    <p>William Bloom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…people do not work and create the economy because they want to support the economy. They create and relate—and this in turn, creates the economy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From David Boyle’s <em>The Little Money Book.</em> His commentary on the quote above: “So don’t be taken in by economists. We created the economy around us, and if we want to change it, we can do just that.”</p>

    <p>Augustine of Hippo’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Augustine.27s_taxonomy_of_lies">taxonomy of lies</a>, deduced from his book <em>On Lying (De Mendacio)</em> (395) in order of descending severity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Lies in religious teaching.</li>
    <li>Lies that harm others and help no one.</li>
    <li>Lies that harm others and help someone.</li>
    <li>Lies told for the pleasure of lying.</li>
    <li>Lies told to “please others in smooth discourse.”</li>
    <li>Lies that harm no one and that help someone.</li>
    <li>Lies that harm no one and that save someone’s life.</li>
    <li>Lies that harm no one and that save someone’s “purity.”</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Svenn Lindskold and Pamela Walters reduce those by 2—though Augustine’s previous work is uncited— in “Categories for the Acceptability of Lies” (1983). Listed from least permissible to most.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Telling a lie that hurts someone else so that you can gain. In social motivational terms these categories can be said to range from</li>
    <li>Telling a lie that, if successful, could cause others to do something that beneﬁts you while, at the same time, harming themselves or causing themselves a loss.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie to make yourself appear better than you really are or to protect some gain, acquired some time ago, to which you were not really entitled.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie that will inﬂuence others in an ofﬁcial position in such a way that you will gain by their response to you, but they will not be harmed.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie to protect yourself or another from punishment or disapproval for a minor failing or blunder which hurts no one.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie to save others from minor hurt, shame, or embarrassment.</li>
  </ol>
