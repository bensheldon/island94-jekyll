  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I ran across a year-old article I had bookmarked from GovTech entitled <a href="http://www.govtech.com/e-government/Do-Apps-for-Democracy-and-Other.html?id=765522&amp;story_pg=1&amp;full=1">“Do Apps for Democracy and Other Contests Create Sustainable Applications?”</a> ( <a href="http://www.justinmassa.com/">via Justin Massa</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the past two years, innovation contests have swept the country in a contagious craze, from Washington, D.C., to New York City, from San Francisco to Portland. Even first lady Michelle Obama got in on the action in March when she launched Apps for Healthy Kids as part of her campaign aimed to end childhood obesity within a generation.</p>

  <p>In the age of Government 2.0, these catchy contests thrive due to a simple concept: To improve transparency, governments release hundreds of public-sector data sets, which developers then use to create Web-based applications. The best apps win big prizes. The public reaps the rewards of new apps that help them get around New York’s subway system or navigate historical sites in the nation’s capital.</p>

  <p>On the surface, it seems like a win-win situation for all. But local buzz only lasts for so long, especially when a winning app doesn’t always lead to a long-term government contract.</p>

  <p>…the contests let city officials advertise transparency efforts and collaborate with citizens to address local issues. But because applications submitted in the competitions don’t go through normal procurement channels, [Jay] Nath [manager of innovation for San Francisco] said, cities cannot use them as “official” apps. That means the shelf life of the winning app is left in the hands of the developers.</p>

  <p>Just ask Brian Sobel, one of the three developers of the website iLive.at, where users can learn about a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., by plugging in an address. After winning the top individual prize for the district’s first Apps for Democracy contest, he remembers meeting the mayor and attending press conferences. But eventually the hoopla died down. And without any incentives to keep the data up-to-date, he said, the free site has “gone kind of stale.”</p>

  <p>“We produced something, and we were part of this whole to-do,” he said. “That was great. But there was no next step, so we all went back to our gainfully employed ventures. They could have asked us to buy a next phase of the project, but they didn’t because they didn’t have the infrastructure set up for that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time, I left this note in Google Reader:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are these contests done in concert with other initiatives (like CDBGs)? Are they engaging horizontally (community groups and social orgs) or just vertically (coders)? I’m at the periphery of the pubdata movement, but I fail to see broad engagement (tongue in cheek: as measured by nobody asking me about it)</p>

  <p>Are these contests structured (do a funding round of engagement, then coding, then deployment and evaluation)? Do the contest questions/project descriptions talk about how the project was designed and the structure for which it will be completed or is the focus just on the final product? As someone who designs and evaluates capacity building grants, I’ve found greater success by scrutinizing the workplan more than the impact statement. Of course, overpromising and underfunding is no surprise in the social sector.</p>

    <p>Chris Rabb’s <em>Invisible Capital</em> uses a quote from Robert Mangabeira Unger and Cornel West’s <em>The Future of American Progressivism:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To understand your country, you must love it. To love it, you must, in a sense, accept it. To accept it as how it is, however is to betray it. To accept your country without betraying it, you must love it for that in it which shows what it might become. America—this monument to the genius of ordinary men and women, this place where hope becomes capacity, this long, halting turn of the no into the yes—needs citizens who love it enough to reimagine and remake it.”</p>

    <p>Matt Webb posted <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2011/03/11/inbox_hero">“Inbox Hero”</a> about a month back (via <a href="http://www.ajmcguire.com/">AJ</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rand: The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.</p>

  <p>Anyway, I’ve been thinking about an email app built on a principle of Objectivism. At the moment, my email client defaults to doing nothing, and I must intervene to create action (ie, write a reply).</p>

  <p>But if I had an Objectivist email app, it would automatically respond to all emails with stock enabling and forceful replies after a period of (say) 15 minutes, and I would have to intervene if I wanted it to not do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I shared it in Google Reader and Tom Wolf (who I’ve <a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/10/teaching-through-breakage/">quoted before</a>) replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a neat way to think about building applications. Rather than starting from “let’s solve a problem”, start from “given this solution, how should it behave assuming I hold X as my primary belief framework?” I’m not sure it’s a <em>practical</em> way to build apps for the masses, but it’s pretty cool nonetheless :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And just in minor regards to Objectivism, I inadvertently dabbled in it when I was about 14 but fortunately quickly outgrew it.</p>

<p>I am remiss to finally get around to blogging <a href="http://dayoftheshirt.com">Day of the Shirt</a>, which I launched back in October, 2010. It’s a straightforward and (hopefully) aesthetically-pleasing t-shirt aggregator.</p>

<p>What’s nifty about Day of the Shirt is that it’s built entirely with  <a href="http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/">PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser</a>. And when I say entirely, I mean <em>entirely</em>: there is no database backend, everything is scraped, including itself. Day of the Shirt…</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>scrapes t-shirt vendors to get names, links and thumbnails (which are cropped and cached);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scrapes, parses and rewrites its own DOM when new shirts are added (we’re serving completely static html);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and scrapes itself to compose its <a href="http://twitter.com/dayoftheshirt">daily tweets</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That last step is a little extravagant, but I wanted to separate the early-morning website update from the mid-morning tweeting—otherwise only the early birds would ever see the tweet. Of course, I re-used the <a href="http://www.island94.org/2010/08/p-np-and-panlexicon/">tweet-composing algorithm</a> from <a href="http://panlexicon.com">Panlexicon</a>.</p>

<p>Now the unfortunate part of this project was that I did a fair amount of competition research prior to building this website—but it wasn’t until about a week after I launched that I discovered an equivalent service: <a href="http://www.teemagnet.com/">Tee Magnet</a>. <em>C’est la vie.</em></p>

    <p>Exploring the recesses of my email I came across some bad ideas I gave to a good friend, neighbor and excellent “Social Media Community Architect and Manager” as we were exploring possible resume headers for him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I were to take the best amalgamation of words, I would go with “Social Media Community Architect and Manager”—which is somewhat awkward. I think you want the words:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>social (which is the buzzword of online social networking);</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>community (which is both online and offline and has a certain fuzziness to it); and</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>something that describes the process of creation… and management.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>I would shy clear of the word technology… “media” definitely has more hotness right now. Maybe “Social Media and Community Architect”.</p>

  <p>What about “Social Media and Community Entrepreneur” (everyone loves an Entrepreneur and I would say you qualify more than anyone I know… though it is somewhat heartless)</p>

  <p>I went through my contacts on LinkedIn and picked out some words/phrases they use to describe themselves:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Community Technologist</li>
    <li>Online Community Manager</li>
    <li>strategic planning for your online social network initiatives</li>
    <li>Building and Executing Social Media Business Strategy</li>
    <li>Rich Media Developer</li>
    <li>Interactive Marketing Executive</li>
    <li>Technology Coordinator</li>
    <li>Community Architect</li>
    <li>community &amp; communications coordinator</li>
    <li>New Media</li>
    <li>hybrid social media</li>
    <li>collaboration technology</li>
    <li>listening technology</li>
    <li>Emerging</li>
    <li>Link Development</li>
    <li>Interactive</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he went with something sensible like “Community Alchemist”.</p>

    <p>It’s kind’ve funny how in some contexts I’m a shut-up-and-go radical and in others I’m a hold-your-horses conservative. In response to <a href="http://nonprofiteer.net/2011/01/19/the-rich-get-richer-once-more/">this article on the Nonprofiteer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If institutions of higher learning want to maintain their tax-favored status, they should abolish legacy preferences. If they don’t—if they go on practicing white people’s affirmative action—they deserve to be knocked off the comfortable perch on which they now sit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… I left this <a href="http://nonprofiteer.net/2011/01/19/the-rich-get-richer-once-more/#comment-5207">comment</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m sympathetic to the overall sentiment, but I’m always worried when an organization’s activities are judged against an arbitrary measure of “nonprofitness”. The strength of the sector—hard fought over 150 years of legislation and case law—is the breadth of allowable activity. The danger of reform is codifying subjective and contemporary distaste as unlawful behavior, thus limiting the ability of truly transformative organizations to form or function. How might Howard University, for example, find egalitarian social benefit in favoring legacy students?</p>

  <p>When an organization’s status as a “nonprofit” is the basis for allegations of hypocrisy I find that the outcome usually furthers the goals of those who wish to do away with the nonprofit sector by doing away with taxes entirely (and by extension their social and redistributive benefits). Which is not to dismiss all nonprofit reform (I am quite in support of transparency and reporting), but the real issue here is not “How can we get more poor kids into Harvard?” but “Harvard should not be your only or best option.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I agree with the response I received back from the Nonprofiteer—which goes to the strength of dialogue as tool for <a href="http://www.island94.org/2008/12/the-nonprofit-between-scylla-and-charydbis/">navigating between two extremes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fair point–and I may have overstated my own (so new?). I certainly am not part of the group you describe which opposes taxes–far from it. But the nonprofit community has long regarded itself as above criticism, and I think the portions of it which foster inequality should be called to account. Perhaps depriving those institutions of their nonprofit status is using a sledgehammer where a scalpel would be preferable–I’m certainly open to that possibility. But that there is an ailment to be addressed strikes me as indisputable.</p>

    <p>I find the concept of feminization—how the presence or predominance of women in certain roles or occupations affect those roles and occupations, their legitimacy, compensation, etc.—to be fascinating and directly affect areas I work in (nonprofits, service, social media). Below is the abstract from a paper presented to the American Sociological Association by Paula England, Paul Allison, Yuxiao Wu, and Mary Ross entitled <a href="http://www.genderbias.net/docs/resources/guideline/Does%20bad%20pay%20cause%20occupations%20to%20feminize,%20Does%20feminization%20reduce%20pay,%20and%20How%20can%20we%20tell%20with%20longitudinal.pdf">“Does Bad Pay Cause Occupations to Feminize, Does Feminization Reduce Pay, and How Can We Tell with Longitudinal Data?” (2004)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Predominantly female occupations pay less than “male” jobs, even after adjusting for skill demands. The devaluation perspective sees sex composition to affect wages; it says that gender bias affects employers’ decisions about the relative pay of “male” and “female” jobs. The queuing or relative-attractiveness view sees occupations’ sex composition to be affected by their reward level, with less attractive jobs going to women because employers prefer men and can get them in jobs that pay well. Past longitudinal research on how changes in occupations pay and sex composition are related has employed the cross-lagged panel (lagged-Y- regressor) model, generally finding support for the devaluation but not the queuing/relative attractiveness view. We argue that a stronger statistical approach to assessing causal dynamics is a fixed-effects model with lagged independent variables. Using CPS data from 1983 to 2001, we test these two perspectives. We find support for neither idea. That is, generally, the feminization of occupations does not lower their wages, and a fall in occupations’ relative wages does not lead to feminization. <strong>We conclude that in earlier historical processes, as occupations and organizations originate, there was a causal relationship between pay and sex composition, but that the continuing relationship is due to institutional inertia freezing in that early relationship, rather than to ongoing causal dynamics.</strong></p>

<p>Above is the signup form from <a href="http://brompt.com">Brompt</a>, the blog reminder service I built a few years ago for undisciplined bloggers like myself. I’m very proud of this form: it’s clear, it contextualizes the data being requested within the functionality of the application, and it drives people to action.</p>

<p>There are a few areas for improvement: asking for your RSS feed rather than your blog’s URL is a bit roundabout (autodetection is still in the feature parking lot) and it could use a little explanation at the top in case you bypassed the front page’s explanation of the service.</p>

<p>Another reason I’m proud of this form is that it was built using Drupal’s Forms API—and Drupal uses awful, unintuitive forms like they were going out of style.</p>

    <p>Writing about <em>Survival News</em> <a href="http://www.island94.org/2011/03/advocacy-in-print-survival-news-for-2011/">yesterday</a>, it behooves me to quote from Francine Adkins-Alexander’s <a href="http://mediacomment.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/progressive-medias-wrong-turn-adversaries-vs-advocates/">“Progressive media’s wrong turn: Adversaries vs. Advocates”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would seem progressive media has missed a tremendous opportunity by taking up the adversarial format. Even though individual programs have enjoyed great success and have succeeded to a large extent in countering much of the vitriol and misinformation coming from corporate-funded conservative talk radio, they have not improved the media landscape. If anything, the [adversarial] “progressive format” has overshadowed those few outlets that dig for unreported stories, while presenting itself as one of those very outlets. It has, to a large extent, replaced advocacy with sensationalism and front page hysteria. It has made progressive media bigger and shinier — but not better.</p>

  <p>I would like to think we will see the advent of yet another format geared to the progressive community, one that emphasizes advocacy. The advantage to this format is that it is not angry and it doesn’t need to blame, meaning that it can attract NPR audiences that avoid adversarial formats. It focuses on issues and how to solve problems. It can keep an audience energized by bringing to light situations that may be ignored by the mainstream media. And it can give audiences a sense of purpose. There is certainly room for anger when it comes to our social ills, but our reaction should not stop there. Progressive media was headed in that direction before it was co-opted by a few big guns that used conservative media as their blue print [e.g. Air America Radio, the Huffington Post] . Progressives are about progress, making changes, getting things done. The conservative format is not optimal for that kind of engagement.</p>

  <p>The best journalistic infrastructure is still found at the larger news agencies, like the Times and the Post. If a key story is going to be broken, it will likely be broken at one of the big shops. And it will be highlighted or buried there. Progressive news aggregators serve an essential purpose in making sure we know the non-corporate storyline. I’d like to see progressive media even stronger in that role, combined with a broadcast format that keeps people involved as well as informed. That will require a shift in framework and media style. I hope someone, somewhere, is working on this approach.</p>
