    <p>From Marianne M. Jennings’ <em>The Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse: How to Spot Moral Meltdowns in Companies… Before It’s Too Late</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sign #7: Goodness in some areas atones for evil in others</strong></p>

  <p>…Beware the socially responsible company. Watch out for the big donors. There is a certain con component in the Yeehaw Culture. The con men and women of the Yeehaw Culture have ﬁgured out a formula for drawing attention away from company performance and, in many cases, its ﬁnancials. Even without the Yeehaw Culture, this dedication to causes and charity seems to be a distraction from running the business. The result is not just a lack of focus, but also a diversion of funds that were needed for simple things, including, for example, the employees’ pensions. That distraction comes in the form of virtuous efforts in the community, charities, and all those social goals one can now ﬁnd on pretty much every company’s website. Stunningly, that information will be located on the investor-information home page. As cynical as it seems, skepticism about social responsibility and philanthropy may be one of the most certain determinants of a Yeehaw Culture. If you ﬁnd these present in a company, check for the other factors of ethical collapse because the generosity and service may be a cover in a troubled soul and even more troubled books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The term “yeehaw culture” comes from the Wyoming Law Reviews’ “Restoring Ethical Gumption in the Corporation: A Federalist Paper on Corporate Governance—Restoration of Active Virtue in the Corporate Structure to Curb the ‘Yeehaw Culture’ in Organizations”. It’s also the cry of Billy Crystal in <em>City Slickers</em>.</p>

<p>The book also encourages researching the community connections between management and charities.</p>

<p>Last week I completed a 2 day <a href="http://www.ica-usa.org/index.php?pr=whatistop">Technology of Participation</a> Facilitator training. Developed by the <a href="http://www.ica-usa.org/index.php">Institute of Cultural Affairs</a>, the Technology of Participation is a series of practices and principles for leading groups through inclusive and participatory dialogues and planning. The training was led by <a href="http://www.gammybird.com/">Nancy Jackson</a> and <a href="http://www.donahue.umassp.edu/services/earlyed/headstart/staff">Ruth-Ann Rasbold</a>, who were excellent.</p>

<p>One of my first questions in the training was the ethical/political dimension to leading participatory methods (after an early morning drive to New Hampshire, I was feeling punchy). Here are the circumstances when participation doesn’t work (from the facilitator handbook):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>there is no intention of using the information gathered, the plans made, or the excitement generated when people become involved.</li>
    <li>people are attached to a particular outcome.</li>
    <li>truth telling is not an accepted norm in an organization.</li>
    <li>people are so busy, they are unwilling to set aside the time needed to engage in participatory processes or follow through on their collective decisions.</li>
    <li>there is no apparent need to do things differently</li>
    <li>the leader does not champion participation</li>
    <li>people want a quick ﬁx to a deep problem</li>
    <li>participation is performed around a non-issue or merely a surface issue—that is, when the focus is to “straighten something out.”</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>from Participation Works: Business Cases from Around the World, James P. Troxel (ed.) with the Institute of Cultural Affairs, Alexandria,Virginia, Miles River Press, 1993, p. 28.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I participated in the facilitator training both because of my enjoyment in facilitating small groups—and my desire to improve my methods and confidence for facilitating larger groups—and that my boss is also trained in the Technology of Participation and I’ve quite enjoyed being a participant in the use of these methods.</p>

    <p>From the <a href="http://www.odnetwork.org/aboutod/principles.php">Organizational Development Network</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition of OD</strong></p>

  <p>Organization Development is a dynamic values-based approach to systems change in organizations and communities; it strives to build the capacity to achieve and sustain a new desired state that benefits the organization or community and the world around them.</p>

  <p><strong>Principles of Practice</strong></p>

  <p>The practice of OD is grounded in a distinctive set of core values and principles that guide behavior and actions.</p>

  <p><strong>Values-Based</strong></p>

  <p>The practice of OD is grounded in a distinctive set of core values and principles that guide behavior and actions. Values-Based Key Values include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respect and Inclusion</strong> – equitably values the perspective and opinions of everyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – builds collaborative relationships between the practitioner and the client while encouraging collaboration throughout the client system.</li>
    <li><strong>Authenticity</strong> – strives for authenticity and congruence and encourages these qualities in their clients</li>
    <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> – commits to developing self-awareness and interpersonal skills. OD practitioners engage in personal and professional development through lifelong learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Empowerment</strong> – focuses efforts on helping everyone in the client organization or community increase their autonomy and empowerment to levels that make the workplace and/or community satisfying and productive.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Supported by Theory</strong></p>

  <p>Draws from multiple disciplines that inform an understanding of human systems, including applied behavioral and physical sciences</p>

  <p><strong>Systems Focused</strong></p>

  <p>Approaches communities and organizations as open systems; that is, acts with the knowledge that change in one area of a system always results in changes in other areas; and change in one area cannot be sustained without supporting changes in other areas of the system.</p>

  <p><strong>Action Research</strong></p>

  <p>Continuously reexamines, reflects and integrates discoveries throughout the process of change in order to achieve desired outcomes. In this way, the client members are involved both in doing their work, and in dialogue about their reflection and learning in order to apply them to achieve shared results.</p>

  <p><strong>Process Focused</strong></p>

  <p>Intervenes in organizational or community processes to help bring about positive change and help the client work toward desired outcomes</p>

  <p><strong>Informed by Data</strong></p>

  <p>Involves proactive inquiry and assessment of the internal environment in order to discover and create a compelling need for change and the achievement of a desired future state of the organization or community. Some methods include survey feedback, assessment tools, interviewing, focus groups, story telling, process consultation and observation.</p>

  <p><strong>Client Centered</strong></p>

  <p>Focuses on the needs of the client in order to continually promote client ownership of all phases of the work and support the client’s ability to sustain change after the consultant engagement ends.</p>

  <p><strong>Focused on Effectiveness and Health</strong></p>

  <p>Helps to create and sustain a healthy effective human system as an interdependent part of its larger environment.</p>

    <li>Telling a lie that hurts someone else so that you can gain. In social motivational terms these categories can be said to range from</li>
    <li>Telling a lie that, if successful, could cause others to do something that beneﬁts you while, at the same time, harming themselves or causing themselves a loss.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie to make yourself appear better than you really are or to protect some gain, acquired some time ago, to which you were not really entitled.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie that will inﬂuence others in an ofﬁcial position in such a way that you will gain by their response to you, but they will not be harmed.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie to protect yourself or another from punishment or disapproval for a minor failing or blunder which hurts no one.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie to save others from minor hurt, shame, or embarrassment.</li>

    <p>From <em>Active Voices: Composing a Rhetoric for Social Movements</em> by Sharon McKenzie Stevens. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_l7PoDouA4IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Chapter 2</a>, “Vernacular Rhetoric and Social Movements: Performances of Resistance in the Rhetoric of the Everyday”, by Gerard A Hauser and Erin Daina McClellan (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the communication tradition of rhetoric, studies of social movements mostly have focused on the discourse of leaders, on single events, or on movement strategies. Although leader rhetoric is signiﬁcant in shaping a movement and explaining its causes and objectives to an observing public, it provides a speciﬁc interpretation of what caused the movement, what it means to those involved, and what it aspires to achieve. As Touraine (1983) has shown, when the movement’s rank-and-ﬁle is invited to explain it, they often give different accounts once the leader leaves the room. <strong>Ignoring rank-and-ﬁle voices in the rhetorical criticism of social movements is problematic. It leads to a skewed picture of the public sphere by deﬁning it in terms of privileged voices.</strong> Even in social movements, leaders have greater access to the podium, press,and public attention than those whose resistance is expressed in rhetorical exchanges of the everyday. Second, it misses resistance found in seemingly mundane expressions, such as modes of politeness that, to the knowing eye of the oppressed, convey an ironic critique of domination but, to the blind eye of the censor, evade detection. Third, they ignore Bakhtinian-like dialogizing exchanges between the dominant and dominated within and across classes. Fourth, a focus on leader statements interprets bodily displays of opposition through the ﬁlter of a movement’s formal rhetoric rather than regarding them as rhetorical performances in their own right. FinallyL ignoring rank-and-ﬁle voices deﬂects attention from the hidden transcripts of resistance developed in hush harbors and the underground that later puncture the patina of the ofﬁcial realm as public expressions of discontent. Here we wish to clarify that our point is not to dismiss leader-focused studies of movements, but rather to indicate the need for greater attention to the vernacular rhetoric that occurs among social actors who are part of a movement.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Carl Rogers on the seven stages of change (cribbed from <a href="http://www.behik.com/2009/04/rogers-and-the-path-to-personal-growth/">here</a>, who cribbed it from <em>Making Sense of Change Management</em> by Esther Cameron and Mike Green):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>an unwillingness to communicate about self, only externals;</li>
    <li>no desire for change;</li>
    <li>feelings neither recognized nor owned;</li>
    <li>problems neither recognized nor perceived.</li>

    <li>feelings may be shown but not owned;</li>
    <li>problems perceived but seen as external;</li>
    <li>no sense of personal responsibility;</li>
    <li>experience more in terms of the past not the present.</li>

  <p>Three:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a little talk about the self, but only as an object;</li>
    <li>expression of feelings, but in the past;</li>
    <li>non-acceptance of feelings; seen as bad, shameful, abnormal;</li>
    <li>recognition of contradictions;</li>
    <li>personal choice seen as ineffective.</li>

  <p>Four:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>more intense past feelings;</li>
    <li>occasional expression of current feelings;</li>
    <li>distrust and fear of direct expression of feelings;</li>
    <li>a little acceptance of feelings;</li>
    <li>possible current experiencing;</li>
    <li>some discovery of personal constructs;</li>
    <li>some feelings of self-responsibility in problems;</li>
    <li>close relationships seen as dangerous;</li>
    <li>some small risk-taking.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Five:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>feelings freely expressed in the present;</li>
    <li>surprise and fright at emerging feelings;</li>
    <li>increasing ownership of feelings;</li>
    <li>increasing self-responsibility;</li>
    <li>clear facing up to contradictions and incongruence.</li>

  <p>Six:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>previously stuck feelings experienced in the here and now;</li>
    <li>the self seen as less of an object, more of a feeling;</li>
    <li>some physiological loosening;</li>
    <li>some psychological loosening – that is, new ways of seeing the world and the self;</li>
    <li>incongruence between experience and awareness reduced.</li>

  <p>Seven:</p>

<p><em>Brooklyn Follies</em> by Paul Auster:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All men contain several men inside them, and most of us bounce from one self to another without ever knowing who we are. Up one day and down the next; morose and silent in the morning, laughing and cracking jokes at night. Harry had been low when he talked to Tom, but now that his business venture was in the works, he was flying high with me.</p>

    <p>An exceprt from “Internment Camp: The Intern Economy and the Culture Trust (Interns Built the Pyramids)” by Jim Federick in <a href="http://www.thebaffler.com/archive"><em>The Baffler</em></a> ( <a href="http://www.thebaffler.com/issue/33">1997: Vol. 1, No. 9.</a>) - mentioned by  <a href="http://www.localpolitechs.com/">Henri Makembe</a> on the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Mission-Based-Massachusetts/">Mission Based Massachusetts listserv</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>All Internships Lead to MTV</strong></p>

  <p>Given the fact that they benefit so handsomely from the intern economy, it is no surprise that the media routinely run stories on the virtues of internships. The stories always seem to follow the same pattern. First comes the bad news about how tough it is out there: “For 17 years straight, A. Todd Iannucelli made a late summer trip to the stationary store to buy loose-leafsheets for classroom note-taking,” goes one cautionary tale that appeared in August 1995 in the Washington Post. “This year, he went to replenish a dwindling supply of resume paper, having joined a growing number of college grads who, as fall approaches, remain jobless and planless.” Then they assure us that internships are the only way a college kid is going to get by in the cutthroat world of the Culture Trust: “Consultants say the route has become a popular one with savvy jobseekers,” the Post continues. “For a new entrant into the job market, volunteering or unpaid internships may be the only ways to amass credentials”</p>

  <p>It should hardly surprise us, given the amount they stand to gain from the unfettered operating of the intern economy, that the hippest publications are among the most regular and most sanguine chroniclers of the intern’s happy lot. Rolling Stone, a notorious intern abuser, runs gooey features on the glories of unpaid internships in its annual college issue. One year it profiled the lucky guy who drove the Oscar Meyer weinermobile, the even luckier guy who got to fetch lunch for Howard Stern, and, luckiest of all, the New York Knicks towel guy. But Rolling Stone doesn’t want Chip and Jessica getting swollen heads just because they get to sweat for the stars, and so on occasion it will tincture the standard categories of the intern story with a certain wholesome contempt for the young people who put themselves out for the glamour business. “You would be surprised how many intelligent people cannot take a cohesive phone message or Xerox more than one copy of a document,” it quoted Victoria Rowan, a woman who had risen from internhood to be a powerful and glamorous assistant editor at Mirabella, as saying back in 1993. “It’s not a game of shit on the peon. Coffee has to be ordered.” Indeed it does, gentle Victoria. But if you’re not paying the peon minimum you are, in fact, shitting on her. Even girl-empowering Sassy gets in on the act, following in 1995 the heroic exploits of an intern at - surprise - MTV: “Biggest perk: We got to go to Madonna’a Bedtime Story Pajama Party at Webster Hall (a huge club in New York City). Worst part of the job: We have to go up to the 50th floor a lot, and the elevator makes me nauseous.</p>

  <p>But to read the most addle-eyed intern-economy glorification of all you have to turn to the new New Yorker, which in October 1994 ran Rocking in Shangri-La: a story by John Seabrook about interns at - you guessed it - MTV. The story actually attempts to convince readers that “the real power brokers at MTV are not President Shirley McGrath, Chair Tom Freston, or even Viacom Chair Sumner Redstone, but its “employees under the age of twenty-five.” “When you are in your early twenties and you are working for MTV,” Seabrook writes, in one of the most appallingly misguided tributes to the Culture Trust to appear to date, “you carry in your brain, muscles, and gonads a kind of mystical authority that your bosses don’t possess.” After 14 long pages it turns out that the “authority” possessed by the low-paid production assistants and the unpaid interns boils down to this: They are walking, talking demographic surveys who tell executives what ia cool and what sucks. In exchange, they get free MTV stuff! And they’re allowed to listen to music as loud as they want! Often, observes the venerable New Yorker, interns will “rock out together for a moment before continuing along the hall,” because, we are told, “employees who think that a particular song ‘rules’ are encouraged to crank it.”</p>

    <p>Peter Klausler’s <a href="http://klausler.com/cargo.html">“Principles of the American Cargo Cult”</a> is one of my favorite statements (even more when applied to the idea of “best practices”).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>II. Causality is selectable</strong></p>

  <p><strong>All interconnection is apparent</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Otherwise, complicated explanations would be necessary.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>The end supports the explanation of the means</strong></p>

  <p><strong>A successful person’s explanation of the means of his success is highly credible by the very fact of his success.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>You can succeed by emulating the purported behavior of successful people</strong></p>

  <p>This is the key to the cargo cult. To enjoy the success of another, just mimic the rituals he claims to follow.</p>

  <p>Your idol gets the blame if things don’t work out, not you.</p>

  <p><strong>You have a right to your share</strong></p>

  <p>You get to define your share.</p>

  <p>Your share is the least you will accept without crying injustice.</p>

  <p>Celebrate getting more than your share.</p>

    <p>A subchapter on art from K.C. Cole’s <em>Something incredibly wonderful happens: Frank Oppenheimer and the world he made up</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A Matter of Urgency</strong></p>

  <p><em>“It’s through familiarity with the arts that I think we will make the kinds of changes that make life stay human.”</em></p>

  <p>A respect for aesthetics, Frank thought, should be a central part of sound decision-making. He didn’t think it would be out of place — though he admitted it would be impractical — if Congress, unable to decide on a difﬁcult matter, took a recess to visit the National Gallery for guidance. “Art,” he liked to say, “is not valid merely to decorate our surroundings with statues in the plazas of skyscrapers, any more than science is valid because it provides the conveniences of electric shavers.”</p>

  <p>When people said, “We need more art,” Frank complained, they tended to say it in the same tone of voice they used to say, “We need more trees.” True, both art and trees make our surroundings more pleasant, but artists also make discoveries about nature and human nature that are on the same level as the discoveries scientists make. And in the same way that we can make better decisions about global warming if we know what scientists have discovered about the earth’s changing climate, so we can make better decisions about human affairs and environments if we pay better attention to what artists have learned.</p>

  <p>Frank worried a lot that the arts were undervalued, and that aesthetic considerations were largely ignored whether people were designing schools, supermarkets, bridges, or “topless dance joints, nuclear weapons, and homes for the aged.” If money was tight, aesthetics was the ﬁrst thing to go. “We’re in terrible trouble because of that,” he said. Historically, places that respected the arts and based decisions on aesthetics were also places where “better things happen,” he argued. If art were considered more important, he wrote to David Rockefeller, “many of the things that now shock or degrade people’s sensitivities would not be tolerated.”</p>

  <p>Of course, as a physicist Frank had learned to trust aesthetics. Scientists often try things because they “smell right.” They believe in theories because the mathematics behind them are “beautiful,” even when they contradict evidence. Like artists, scientists develop an eye (and ear) for nature, a sense of what is true and what is not. Laypeople, too, should be encouraged to rely on their aesthetic sense to guide their decisions, Frank thought; if a certain course of action or behavior struck them as “ugly,” then it probably was.</p>

  <p>Artists and scientists, Frank liked to say, are the ofﬁcial “noticers” of society — those who help us pay attention to things we’ve either never learned to see or have learned to ignore. Artists of all ages and in all lands have traditionally sensitized people to nature through their poetry and painting, sculpture and drama, and, less obviously, through their music. Without art, “one even ignores what people’s faces are like,” Frank said, “but by seeing paintings of people’s faces you begin to look at them again, and I think that the same thing is true of science. You look at the sky and you see the stars, and it is just an amorphous mass; but suddenly somebody talks to you about it and you see that some stars move with respect to other stars.”</p>

  <p>He gave artists credit for teaching us great human truths. Without art we might not have recognized the universality of the feeling between mother and child, he said, or the emotion between man and woman.</p>

  <p>“If you don’t know how to notice, you can’t do anything well,” Frank said. “You can’t even relate to people well.” You can’t tell if someone is angry or amused or hurt, or if the weather is about to change and maybe you should get an umbrella. You’ll miss that guy lurking in the shadows, and Saturn shining overhead.</p>

  <p>Frank wondered why urban planners didn’t look at paintings in order to learn how to design cities; why architects didn’t look at Cezannes to design cafés; why people didn’t look at portraits to ﬁnd meaning and wonder in the transformations that occur in aging faces and bodies. Why didn’t people realize that paintings enable us to ﬁnd pattern and structure in scenes that would otherwise seem shapeless, amorphous, and emotionless?</p>

  <p>So above all else, the Exploratorium was a place that encouraged the kind of everyday noticing that helped people develop an eye and ear and feel for the social and physical universe aroundthem — an almost artistic sensibility.</p>

  <p>Visitors to the Exploratorium certainly build up intuitive feelings for physical phenomena as much from artistic works as from “science” exhibits — whether the subject is wave mechanics or the nature of light or ﬂuid dynamics or the quantum properties of matter. To this day, when I imagine stars being born from swirling interstellar clouds, I think of Ned Kahn’s “Whirlpool”; when I think of exotic bits of matter coming into being seemingly out of nothing, I see his “Visible Effects of the Invisible.” Most of my intuitive feel for light and color and shadow and reﬂection comes from Bob Miller, and there is a lot of the spinning black hole in Doug Hollis’s “Vortex.”</p>

  <p>Even in terms of process, Frank pointed out, artists and scientists work in similar ways. They both start by noticing patterns in space and time, trying to make sense of them, rearranging them, and then linking patterns together in ways no one had thought to do before. They make sketches with equations or charcoal. They elaborate and synthesize. “They end up with a composition which means more than what they started with,” Frank wrote — melodies and theories. In essence, they make patterns of patterns that reveal new insights. Their compositions, theories, and other works separate relevancies from trivialities; provide a framework for memory; reassure by creating order out of confusion.</p>

  <p>Of course, all people spend much of their time perceiving and making sense of patterns; even animals do it (the dog knows exactly what follows the fetching of the leash). Frank once told me that when he can’t see a pattern, he gets “miserable.” But artists and scientists spend their whole lives looking for patterns in nature, and so perhaps learn to see more than the rest of us.</p>

  <p>To Frank, artists were people who looked at human experience in the same way astronomers looked at the sky through telescopes. Just as astronomers collect, codify, interpret, and communicate what is known about the stars, so artists collect, codify, interpret, and communicate what we know about human feelings.</p>

  <p>The reason we need this knowledge so much, he argued, is the rapid pace of change. If things didn’t change, then perhaps education could simply be a matter of learning to conduct business and follow directions. But everything in nature changes. People inevitably change the world in which they live. They change themselves. And as people(s) change, at some level there’s always a worry that we might lose some of that indeﬁnable and extraordinary specialness that makes people human. And who can define that essential nature of humanity we so want to preserve? Who can tell us (or remind us) what is ﬁne, what is beautiful, what is important, in humankind? Frank claimed that was the role of artists.</p>

  <p>Decisions about how to adapt to inevitable changes are based, by necessity, on what we believe is possible. Science tells us what is possible in the physical realm, and in doing so, gives us a basis for action. If we don’t know that it’s possible to make antibiotics, for example, we won’t learn how to protect ourselves against disease. In the same way, Frank thought, art tells us what is possible in human experience. What’s more, it tells us how we feel about the various possibilities or at least how an individual artist feels, and therefore one way it is possible to feel. “If you don’t know those things, you are not going to make good decisions,” he said.</p>

  <p>And just as technological inventions help us cope with changes in the external environment, we need “heightened social and emotional awareness and invention,” Frank said, to cope with changes in the human environment.</p>
