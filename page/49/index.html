    <p>An <a href="http://www.yorkshire-culture.co.uk/News/Articles/The_seven_key_challenges_for_non-profit_organisations.html">article on nonprofit challenges</a> from the British org Yorkshire Culture:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In business, we are told that the customer is king; in the non-profit sector it is more like Jack, Queen and King — multiple stakeholders ranging from funders, to brokers to end users. The problem is that the end user or recipient often has very little say in what is being ‘purchased’ on their behalf. To most non-profit organisations the crucial relationship is that shared with the funder or broker, not the end user. If cultural non-profit organisations are to fully exploit their enterprise potential, relationships need to be rebalanced.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And the challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Satisfying the needs of the funders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pricing and cost</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unwilling funders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restricted income</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Handling surplus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Investment problem</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overheads in service delivery</p>

    <p>It’s another election year which means that politics are flying.</p>

<p>From a story on <a href="http://www.townhall.com/news/sci-tech/2008/06/02/nasas_own_watchdog_agency_misled_on_global_warming">NASA forcibly downplaying global warming</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The report did not directly accuse them of lying, but used more nuanced terms such as “<strong>mendacity</strong> “ and “<strong>dissembling</strong>.” The space agency complained those terms were unjust.</p>

<p>And I enjoy how the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/us/politics/17policy.html?pagewanted=2&amp;hp">describes a John McCain statement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like Mr. Bush, Mr. McCain has steadfastly refused to set dates for withdrawals of troops and envisions a long-term American presence in the country. But last month, in the general election battleground state of Ohio, Mr. McCain did a <strong>semantic dance</strong> and said he expected that most American troops would be home from Iraq by 2013.</p>

    <p>Aha! I knew there had to be a word for misusing review quotes. From this week’s <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/nl/krcv.htm">World Wide Words</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Such extracts from reviews are called “pull quotes” in the jargon;massaging them into more favourable versions is “quote doctoring”. Another word, with apologies to Stephen Potter, is “quotemanship”(or “quotesmanship”). “Contextomy” is yet another term, one used principally by academics in reference to literary misquoting. The ending “-tomy” means cutting up and has here been neatly reversed into “context”. It was created by the historian Milton Mayer in 1966 in reference to a much more significant issue, the misquoting
of the Torah for propaganda purposes by Julius Streicher, editor ofthe Nazi paper Der Stürmer in Weimar-era Germany.</p>

    <p>Notes from Rebecca below on managing nonprofit technology projects</p>

<p>http://aspirationtech.org/events/mntp-sf
http://mntp.aspirationtech.org/index.php/Event_Agenda</p>

<p>…maybe I’ll clean this up someday.</p>

<p>ï»¿—-
!!!Basic Stages of a Project</p>
<ol>
  <li>Initiate
* define project
* talk about start and end points, budget, participants/roles, timeline</li>
  <li>Plan
* defining scope, requirements, use cases</li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monitor</p>
  </li>
  <li>Close
*how do you know when you’re done with the project you’re working on?</li>
</ol>

<p>*upkeep/maintenance phase?</p>

<p>*in “waterfall” style projects, there is just one of each step
*in “agile” style projects, the plan -&gt; implement -&gt; monitor cycle repeats
*know which style project it is at the beginning!</p>

<hr />
<p>!!!Content inventories
For redesign processes, figure out what content and navigation is currently present and how it’s organized. Include things like creation dates and web statistics; talk about the value of old content to users. This can affect how much of the content is migrated, and can give organizations insight into how they intend to communicate vs. how they’re actually communicating. For example, one PM working on the ACLU site inventoried 15,000 pages; the ACLU decided to migrate 8,000 of those, and rethought their style of technical &amp; legal language to a more personal approach.</p>

<hr />
<p>!!!Scope Creep
*postpone things to phase 2
*define project endpoints in the “initiate” phase
*specifications that include what ‘‘won’t’’ be included
*review scope and recently developed features regularly
*revisit goals to regain focus as scope creep starts to take over
*saying no: make sure that people are aware of the depth of their requests, especially if they’re out of scope. inform people about research or dev time required just to estimate cost for a feature.</p>

<hr />
<p>!!!Recognizing Impending Doom
*chunking projects: dividing projects into smaller chunks will make overages more obvious.
*development time = developer + QA + PM + client + risk + padding.
*define checkin points in the web plan
*be upfront/honest/immediate when you’re feeling uncomfortable
*be proactive about input–consider what input people will have before you ask them for it
*one attendee mentioned that they “had been trying to stay with this FOSS community which was politically important, but they were making incredibly bad engineering decisions” and they eventually had to break with the FOSS group.
*beware of working with volunteers who aren’t web professionals
*notice the point where transparency starts to drop</p>

<hr />
<p>!!!Client Panic
*lack of communication: presenting a product that the client hasn’t seen before and they aren’t happy
*role changes on either the client or dev side can trigger less dialouge
*when you’re behind, don’t just work harder: restructure dev roles, reopen lines of communication with client
*sign of panic: abusive emails. one dev mentioned having a “2 strike rule” for abusive communication; he immediately calls higher-ups re: lack of tolerance for abusive/blame email/interaction
*learn how to identify ‘‘good’’ things about a client relationship</p>

<p>’'’recovery stragegy’’’: regaining trust is remotely is difficult. Highly structured communication can help; for example, frequent meeting at consistent times with a repeated agenda.</p>

<p>#highly structured communication
#revisit goals
#talk to other members of the client org
#re-structure the project
#fire the client</p>

<hr />
<p>!!!Turning a Project into a Product
*forces you into more standardization
*documentation becomes exponentially more important
*languages &amp; international users: translators can be your most active outside contributors</p>

<hr />
<p>!!!Other
*build test cases alongside app development
*involve real-life people–external stakeholders–in the process
*make sure there is someone within the nonprofit who can maintain the solution
*can you narrow your website’s focus? working with the client to focus the project; can be used to reduce the feature set and budget, AND/OR to clarify the client’s communication strategy.
*get clients to take notes at meetings and send them to you so that you know what they’re taking away/expecting
*discussions about “which tools?” can obscure discussions of needs
*blog or message board for a project: for both issues and for cheerleading
*“the smallest organizations need the most hand-holding”

    <p>I’ve been meaning to type of some of my notes from the NTEN 2008 Conference, but the benefit of waiting is that someone will do it better. Like <a href="http://havefundogood.blogspot.com/2008/03/notes-from-seven-things-everyone-wants.html">Britt Bravo: Notes from The Seven Things Everyone Wants: What Freud and Buddha Understood (and We’re Forgetting) about Online Outreach </a>.</p>

<p>In short (lots more notes and examples in the link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Need 1: To be SEEN and HEARD</strong></p>

  <p>Does your home page make people feel heard? Not many people give money because they read a well word-smithed mission statement. Effective sites and campaigns provide space for people to express themselves. Nonprofits need to truly listen to their supporters and acknowledge what they are saying.</p>

  <p><strong>Need 2: To be CONNECTED to someone or something</strong></p>

  <p>Engage people by connecting to what they (not you!) care about.</p>

  <p>**Need 3: To be part of something GREATER THAN THEMSELVES
**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>**Need 4: To have HOPE for the future
**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doom and gloom, and finger-wagging messages don’t work.</p>

  <p><strong>Need 5: The security of TRUST</strong></p>

  <p>People are starved for a sense of trust in “the messenger.”</p>

  <p>**Need 6: To be of SERVICE
**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The #1 reason people stop giving to a nonprofit is that they feel like they are being treated like an ATM machine. They want to help, but they want to be of service, and to have different ways of serving. That need is not being fulfilled if all they hear is the unimaginative drumbeat of dollars.</p>

  <p>**Need 7: To want HAPPINESS for self and others
**</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The core of Buddhism is that everyone wants happiness and to be free from suffering. The more you want happiness for others, the better it is for you, and them.</p>

    <p>.!.</p>

<p>The cafe down the corner from my house makes the best brownies and I’ve been wanting this recipe ever since they opened. My friends have been quietly debating whether it was corn syrup or condensed milk that makes them so good. I made an oft-hand remark about it today and the counter-girl went back and wrote out the recipe for me. Turns out the answer is butter and eggs, lots of ‘em.</p>

<p>In regard to the amounts below: they were given to me in grams, and I did some loose conversions since I don’t have a scale.</p>

<ul>
  <li>3-1/3 C (760g) Butter</li>
  <li>1-2/3 Lb (910g) Chocolate</li>
  <li>12 Eggs</li>
  <li>2 Tsp Vanilla</li>
  <li>2-1/2 C (560g) Sugar</li>
  <li>3-1/3 C (420g) Flour</li>
  <li>2 Tsp Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>18” X 24” Pan (makes 24 Brownies)</p>

<p>I didn’t get the instructions for actually baking them, but I assume that you melt and cool the chocolate, then cream everything, adding the flour at the end.</p>

<p>Probably bake at 350 (though maybe a cooler 325). They should have a torte-like consistency when done—cakily aerated but moist and fudgy if compressed.</p>

<p>I made a simple chart of approximate seed planting times for Boston (USDA Zone 6). You can <a href="http://island94.org/files/island94.org/Boston Vegetable Planting Chart.pdf">download a printable PDF of the planting chart</a>.</p>

<p>Today I put together a simple raised bed in my backyard. I built it along the same design as the <a href="http://www.thefoodproject.org/agriculture/Internal1.asp?ID=601">Food Project’s Build-a-Garden Program’s planter</a>—which my landlord participated in last year. Other than shoveling 1300 pounds of soil needed for an 8 x 4 raised bed, it was pretty easy. The only really novel part is putting a sheet of weed-block between the ground and the planting soil to keep the vegetables from growing down into polluted city-dirt.</p>

    <p>Dandy’s recipe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>8 medium tomatoes, stewed</li>
  <li>1 jalapeno</li>
  <li>4 green onion, chopped</li>
  <li>1/4 bunch of cilantro, chopped</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
</ul>

<p>Then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In large sauce pan, stew tomatoes and jalepeno.</li>
  <li>Remove stem from jalapeno.</li>
  <li>Put into blender or food processor.</li>
  <li>Add garlic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pour into pan.</li>
  <li>Add 4 green onions and cilantro.</li>
  <li>Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>My alteration</em>:</p>

<p>Take all of the above ingredients, and just throw them in a blender (I use a can of whole stewed tomatoes rather than the fresh tomatoes—probably better fresh). Done._</p>
