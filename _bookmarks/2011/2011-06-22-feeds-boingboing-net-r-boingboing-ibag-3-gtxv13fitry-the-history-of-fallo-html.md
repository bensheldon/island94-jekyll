Fallout shelters were what got me started in online mapping. When I moved to Boston, I saw the signs all over town and thought, how can I track these? Which led me to geotagging (before flickr had the "add to map" tool, when you literally had to tag your photos with lat/lon coordinates) , to geoRSS, to Drupal's googlemap module
