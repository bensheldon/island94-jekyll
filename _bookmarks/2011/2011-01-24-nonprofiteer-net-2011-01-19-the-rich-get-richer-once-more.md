I left a comment on this post. Basically, don't try to limit the choices rich people have to spend their money, just tax it and put it towards democratic public institutions. And trying to limit nonprofits based on some subjective judgement of rightness will probably just come back to bite us in the ass (see NAACP v. Alabama).
