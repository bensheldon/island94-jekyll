In case you missed it: in 6 days we got 1,000 petition signatures (300 online, 700 from volunteers on standing on Mass Ave. over the weekend and in the evening rush hour) and we had 125+ people at the public meeting. We also added 600 people to our mailing list, had a Boston Globe editorial published from our Director (a Globe editor rode past our petitioning volunteers). <br><br>One caveat is that the meeting turnout itself was less diverse than I would have liked. We had one man from Dorchester make the point that we need the bike lanes for this 2/3rds of a mile, but we also need lanes and facilities at the other end of Mass Ave too
