> The open-science movement has always had a tension between burn-it-all-down and here’s-one-quick-trick. Put them together and it kinda sounds like a cult that can’t see outward, but I see it as more the opposite, as an awkward coalition representing fundamentally incoherent views. But both sides of the coalition need each other: the reformers need the old institutional powers to make a real difference in practice, and the oldsters need the reformers because outsiders are losing confidence in the system.
