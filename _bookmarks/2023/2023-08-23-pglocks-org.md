PostgreSQL Lock Conflicts

This tool shows all commands and locks in postgres. If you select a command, it lists the locks that it acquires, commands that conflicts with it and commands are allowed to run concurrently with it without conflict. If you select a lock it lists commands that acquire the lock and what are the other conflicting locks.
