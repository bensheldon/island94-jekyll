> In the heart of Minneapolis stands the Irene Hixon Whitney Footbridge, designed by Siah Armajani. Connecting the Walker Art Museum Sculpture Garden with Loring Park, it has inscribed in its lintel a poem by John Ashbery. Our film, Steel and Air, aims to capture and enhance Ashbery’s poem by chronicling a man’s journey through life.
