title: Rails — narrative vs model centric approach - Max Chernyak

> alternative way of building apps is narrative centric. Instead of creating a web of nodes with ripple effects, I want to write short stories, each living in an entry point (whether that’s a controller action, bg job, rake task, or test). Each story has a beginning (the initiating request/call) and an end (the response/output), with side effects in between. I love seeing a complete story where every major plot point is clearly visible at the controller level.
