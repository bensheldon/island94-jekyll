> Most of the best fun I've had in my life have been in big group projects that required lots of group decision making--putting together community circuses, political activism, starting a business, marriage. But, I've also spent a lot of time participating in group decision making for endeavors and institutions that were very, very far from the best fun. Democracy can be a joy, but it often isn't. I do wish the book attended more to designing for democratic joy.
