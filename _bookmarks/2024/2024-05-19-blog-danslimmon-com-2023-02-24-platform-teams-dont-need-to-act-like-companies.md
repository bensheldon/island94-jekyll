title: Platform teams don’t need to act like companies
tags: []

> the platform team must act like a company, then it should act like a struggling company that’s desperate to keep its last few enterprise customers. This implies a very different strategy than that of a startup. Change as little as possible and put the bulk of your energy into efforts that increase boringness: documenting, simplifying, and fixing. Don’t build anything exciting if you can avoid it, and if you must build something, build it in service of boringness.
