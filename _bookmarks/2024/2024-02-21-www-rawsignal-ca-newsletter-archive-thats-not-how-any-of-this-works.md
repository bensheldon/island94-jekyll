> Your bosses are people who got promoted for doing some other work, and are now trying to figure out this job. They're accountable for your team's work, but are gonna be all over the map in terms of competency and skillset to actually manage that work. You might get very lucky, or very unlucky, but for the most part they don't want to hate their job and don't need you to hate yours. They are just struggling to stay on top of it, and have less time for reflection and self-awareness than they, or you, would like.
