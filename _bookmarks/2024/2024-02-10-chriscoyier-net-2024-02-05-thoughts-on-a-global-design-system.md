title: Thoughts on a Global Design System

> It feels like every decision you make will chip away at who will use it. Say you start out with 1,000 organizations who would use this thing. You make the decision to use Web Components, but 27 organizations just don’t like ’em so they’re out. You’re going to use Lightning CSS to modernize CSS, but 19 organizations can’t fit that into their stack, so they are out. Ninety organizations really just want what they consider to be really slick polished design out of the box, so they are out. Fifteen need a really specific open source license so they can’t do it. There are four organizations that just follow the lead of one that already ruled it out, so they are out. You haven’t finished your Code of Conduct yet so that turned off 8 orgs. What 13 organizations really need is a photo carousel component that has zooming and that’s not really on the roadmap right now so they are out. You’ve decided to go really heavy with CSS custom properties for customization but the way you’ve done it doesn’t slot in nicely with 3 organizations token strategy, so they look elsewhere. On and on.
