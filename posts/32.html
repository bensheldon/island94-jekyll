    <p>From the <a href="http://www.odnetwork.org/aboutod/principles.php">Organizational Development Network</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition of OD</strong></p>

  <p>Organization Development is a dynamic values-based approach to systems change in organizations and communities; it strives to build the capacity to achieve and sustain a new desired state that benefits the organization or community and the world around them.</p>

  <p><strong>Principles of Practice</strong></p>

  <p>The practice of OD is grounded in a distinctive set of core values and principles that guide behavior and actions.</p>

  <p><strong>Values-Based</strong></p>

  <p>The practice of OD is grounded in a distinctive set of core values and principles that guide behavior and actions. Values-Based Key Values include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respect and Inclusion</strong> – equitably values the perspective and opinions of everyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> – builds collaborative relationships between the practitioner and the client while encouraging collaboration throughout the client system.</li>
    <li><strong>Authenticity</strong> – strives for authenticity and congruence and encourages these qualities in their clients</li>
    <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> – commits to developing self-awareness and interpersonal skills. OD practitioners engage in personal and professional development through lifelong learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Empowerment</strong> – focuses efforts on helping everyone in the client organization or community increase their autonomy and empowerment to levels that make the workplace and/or community satisfying and productive.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Supported by Theory</strong></p>

  <p>Draws from multiple disciplines that inform an understanding of human systems, including applied behavioral and physical sciences</p>

  <p><strong>Systems Focused</strong></p>

  <p>Approaches communities and organizations as open systems; that is, acts with the knowledge that change in one area of a system always results in changes in other areas; and change in one area cannot be sustained without supporting changes in other areas of the system.</p>

  <p><strong>Action Research</strong></p>

  <p>Continuously reexamines, reflects and integrates discoveries throughout the process of change in order to achieve desired outcomes. In this way, the client members are involved both in doing their work, and in dialogue about their reflection and learning in order to apply them to achieve shared results.</p>

  <p><strong>Process Focused</strong></p>

  <p>Intervenes in organizational or community processes to help bring about positive change and help the client work toward desired outcomes</p>

  <p><strong>Informed by Data</strong></p>

  <p>Involves proactive inquiry and assessment of the internal environment in order to discover and create a compelling need for change and the achievement of a desired future state of the organization or community. Some methods include survey feedback, assessment tools, interviewing, focus groups, story telling, process consultation and observation.</p>

  <p><strong>Client Centered</strong></p>

  <p>Focuses on the needs of the client in order to continually promote client ownership of all phases of the work and support the client’s ability to sustain change after the consultant engagement ends.</p>

  <p><strong>Focused on Effectiveness and Health</strong></p>

  <p>Helps to create and sustain a healthy effective human system as an interdependent part of its larger environment.</p>

    <p><em>Let’s get polemic.</em></p>

<p>So Forrester Research’s Groundswell has released an update to their Ladder of Participation. Needless to say I’m annoyed. I have already heard from a few close nonprofit friends  <a href="http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/0,7211,42057,00.html">excited</a> (I’m not picking on Beth, <a href="http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2009/03/sxsw-social-media-for-social-good-bbq.html">she <em>gets</em> it</a>) by Forrester Research’s  <a href="http://forrester.typepad.com/groundswell/2007/04/forresters_new_.html">Social Technographics Report</a>. Needless to say, I’m disappointed by their excitement. From the original  <a href="http://forrester.typepad.com/groundswell/2007/04/forresters_new_.html">blog</a> entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The report also lays out how companies can create strategies using Social Technographics. For example, I’ve used the “participation ladder” to help figure out which social strategies to deploy first – and also how to encourage users to “climb up”, so to speak, from being Spectators to becoming more engaged. It’s my belief that not everyone is cut out from the start to be a Creator; nor is everyone inclined to jump with both feet into social networking. Companies seeking to engage customers with these new tools need to understand where their audiences are with this categorization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From a social change perspective, in brief, that’s pretty fucked. And to be clear, it’s that mixing of engagement, audience, and customers. This is the chugger model taken off of the street and put online: engagement being the weasel word for brand identification. This is not about building power; it’s about having someone say something nice about your organization in a public place.</p>

<p>This is Forrester’s ladder:</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/2010-04-08-Broken-ladders/Ladder_3.gif"> <img src="/uploads/2010-04-08-Broken-ladders/Ladder_3.gif" alt="" title="Ladder_3" /> </a></p>

<p>Compare that to another ladder <a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/10/we-participate-they-profit/">I really like</a>: Sherry Arnstein’s Ladder of Citizen Participation (it came out in 1969 so be considerate of its lack of shinyness):</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2010-04-08-Broken-ladders/ladder-of-citizen-participation.gif" alt="" title="Ladder of Civic Participation" /></p>

<p>There is no practice in the Social Technographics report that I would put above the level of Placation (and that’s being generous).</p>

<p>I am disappointed that there are not more people applying existing models of community building to social media. Just because business has discovered the profit potential of relationships—and their apologists are flow-charting it with exuberance—is not a good reason to forget or ignore the large body of practice that has served community organizers and social change organizations for many, many years.</p>

<p><em>And I’m not always _<a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/02/online-fundraising-please-do-it-right/">_pissy_</a></em> when I’m talking about nonprofits online, I just want people to focus less on the tools and more on the <em><a href="http://www.island94.org/2008/09/exploring-poverty-participation-practice-imagination-and-exploration/">_practice_</a></em> (and I don’t mean <em><a href="http://www.island94.org/2009/10/chasing-best-practices/">_“best”_</a></em>)._</p>

    <p>Augustine of Hippo’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Augustine.27s_taxonomy_of_lies">taxonomy of lies</a>, deduced from his book <em>On Lying (De Mendacio)</em> (395) in order of descending severity:</p>

<blockquote>

    <li>Telling a lie that hurts someone else so that you can gain. In social motivational terms these categories can be said to range from</li>
    <li>Telling a lie that, if successful, could cause others to do something that beneﬁts you while, at the same time, harming themselves or causing themselves a loss.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie to make yourself appear better than you really are or to protect some gain, acquired some time ago, to which you were not really entitled.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie that will inﬂuence others in an ofﬁcial position in such a way that you will gain by their response to you, but they will not be harmed.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie to protect yourself or another from punishment or disapproval for a minor failing or blunder which hurts no one.</li>
    <li>Telling a lie to save others from minor hurt, shame, or embarrassment.</li>

    <p>From <em>Active Voices: Composing a Rhetoric for Social Movements</em> by Sharon McKenzie Stevens. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_l7PoDouA4IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Chapter 2</a>, “Vernacular Rhetoric and Social Movements: Performances of Resistance in the Rhetoric of the Everyday”, by Gerard A Hauser and Erin Daina McClellan (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the communication tradition of rhetoric, studies of social movements mostly have focused on the discourse of leaders, on single events, or on movement strategies. Although leader rhetoric is signiﬁcant in shaping a movement and explaining its causes and objectives to an observing public, it provides a speciﬁc interpretation of what caused the movement, what it means to those involved, and what it aspires to achieve. As Touraine (1983) has shown, when the movement’s rank-and-ﬁle is invited to explain it, they often give different accounts once the leader leaves the room. <strong>Ignoring rank-and-ﬁle voices in the rhetorical criticism of social movements is problematic. It leads to a skewed picture of the public sphere by deﬁning it in terms of privileged voices.</strong> Even in social movements, leaders have greater access to the podium, press,and public attention than those whose resistance is expressed in rhetorical exchanges of the everyday. Second, it misses resistance found in seemingly mundane expressions, such as modes of politeness that, to the knowing eye of the oppressed, convey an ironic critique of domination but, to the blind eye of the censor, evade detection. Third, they ignore Bakhtinian-like dialogizing exchanges between the dominant and dominated within and across classes. Fourth, a focus on leader statements interprets bodily displays of opposition through the ﬁlter of a movement’s formal rhetoric rather than regarding them as rhetorical performances in their own right. FinallyL ignoring rank-and-ﬁle voices deﬂects attention from the hidden transcripts of resistance developed in hush harbors and the underground that later puncture the patina of the ofﬁcial realm as public expressions of discontent. Here we wish to clarify that our point is not to dismiss leader-focused studies of movements, but rather to indicate the need for greater attention to the vernacular rhetoric that occurs among social actors who are part of a movement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>All Internships Lead to MTV</strong></p>

  <p>Given the fact that they benefit so handsomely from the intern economy, it is no surprise that the media routinely run stories on the virtues of internships. The stories always seem to follow the same pattern. First comes the bad news about how tough it is out there: “For 17 years straight, A. Todd Iannucelli made a late summer trip to the stationary store to buy loose-leafsheets for classroom note-taking,” goes one cautionary tale that appeared in August 1995 in the Washington Post. “This year, he went to replenish a dwindling supply of resume paper, having joined a growing number of college grads who, as fall approaches, remain jobless and planless.” Then they assure us that internships are the only way a college kid is going to get by in the cutthroat world of the Culture Trust: “Consultants say the route has become a popular one with savvy jobseekers,” the Post continues. “For a new entrant into the job market, volunteering or unpaid internships may be the only ways to amass credentials”</p>

  <p>It should hardly surprise us, given the amount they stand to gain from the unfettered operating of the intern economy, that the hippest publications are among the most regular and most sanguine chroniclers of the intern’s happy lot. Rolling Stone, a notorious intern abuser, runs gooey features on the glories of unpaid internships in its annual college issue. One year it profiled the lucky guy who drove the Oscar Meyer weinermobile, the even luckier guy who got to fetch lunch for Howard Stern, and, luckiest of all, the New York Knicks towel guy. But Rolling Stone doesn’t want Chip and Jessica getting swollen heads just because they get to sweat for the stars, and so on occasion it will tincture the standard categories of the intern story with a certain wholesome contempt for the young people who put themselves out for the glamour business. “You would be surprised how many intelligent people cannot take a cohesive phone message or Xerox more than one copy of a document,” it quoted Victoria Rowan, a woman who had risen from internhood to be a powerful and glamorous assistant editor at Mirabella, as saying back in 1993. “It’s not a game of shit on the peon. Coffee has to be ordered.” Indeed it does, gentle Victoria. But if you’re not paying the peon minimum you are, in fact, shitting on her. Even girl-empowering Sassy gets in on the act, following in 1995 the heroic exploits of an intern at - surprise - MTV: “Biggest perk: We got to go to Madonna’a Bedtime Story Pajama Party at Webster Hall (a huge club in New York City). Worst part of the job: We have to go up to the 50th floor a lot, and the elevator makes me nauseous.</p>

  <p>But to read the most addle-eyed intern-economy glorification of all you have to turn to the new New Yorker, which in October 1994 ran Rocking in Shangri-La: a story by John Seabrook about interns at - you guessed it - MTV. The story actually attempts to convince readers that “the real power brokers at MTV are not President Shirley McGrath, Chair Tom Freston, or even Viacom Chair Sumner Redstone, but its “employees under the age of twenty-five.” “When you are in your early twenties and you are working for MTV,” Seabrook writes, in one of the most appallingly misguided tributes to the Culture Trust to appear to date, “you carry in your brain, muscles, and gonads a kind of mystical authority that your bosses don’t possess.” After 14 long pages it turns out that the “authority” possessed by the low-paid production assistants and the unpaid interns boils down to this: They are walking, talking demographic surveys who tell executives what ia cool and what sucks. In exchange, they get free MTV stuff! And they’re allowed to listen to music as loud as they want! Often, observes the venerable New Yorker, interns will “rock out together for a moment before continuing along the hall,” because, we are told, “employees who think that a particular song ‘rules’ are encouraged to crank it.”</p>

    <p><strong>Posting guidelines for the Mission-Based Massachusetts email list</strong></p>

<p>Dear MBM Colleagues,</p>

<p>The following guidelines for posting to the email discussion list are</p>

<p>based on detailed feedback from members of the group. We ask you to</p>

<p>respect them whenever you post a message.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use only plain text. This list doesn’t support graphics, HTML, or</li>
</ul>

<p>attached documents.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Separate each paragraph with a blank line or listed item.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid using all capital letters. In email, this is equivalent to</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>shouting, and considered an insult to one’s readers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clean up jagged margins; readers tend to get so discouraged by them</li>
</ul>

<p>that they skip your message and go on to the next one.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify yourself. Readers pay more attention to a message when</li>
</ul>

<p>there’s a name and organizational affiliation attached to it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trim, trim, trim! Unnecessary repetitions of previous posts, list</li>
</ul>

<p>footers, and signature lines are tedious for other members to</p>

<p>negotiate. If you’re replying to a previous message, please trim away</p>

<p>everything but the essentials of that message and your response to it.</p>

<p>If you don’t trim your post down, and I think that it would benefit</p>

<p>from trimming, then I edit it myself. This means extra work for me,</p>

<p>and a trim job for your message that you as the author may deem unduly</p>

<p>harsh.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Double-check your subject line, and make sure that it summarizes the</li>
</ul>

<p>topic. If you subscribe to the digest format of the list, then the</p>

<p>subject line will automatically be something like “Digest Number 123.”</p>

<p>Please change it to something more topical. It’s also helpful to trim</p>

<p>away clutter from previous generations of forwarding; “FW: Grants for</p>

<p>Nonprofits” is much more readable than “Fwd: FW: Re: FW: [Boston] RE:</p>

<p>Grants for Nonprofits.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write for a statewide readership. If you say that an event is</li>
</ul>

<p>happening tonight at “the Firehouse in J.P.,” the Bostonians will know</p>

<p>that you mean “the Firehouse Multicultural Art Center in Jamaica</p>

<p>Plain,” but maybe the folks in Pittsfield won’t. And if they need to</p>

<p>drive out from Pittsfield to attend, it’s probably a good idea to give</p>

<p>them more than a few hours’ notice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write about subjects that pertain to nonprofit, philanthropic,</li>
</ul>

<p>educational, community-based, grassroots, socially responsible, and</p>

<p>other mission-oriented organizations in Massachusetts. Readers</p>

<p>subscribe to the list because they are interested in this specific</p>

<p>topic. If you stray too far from it, other members of the group are</p>

<p>likely to ignore your messages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have products, services, or trainings to sell, please</li>
</ul>

<p>exercise the greatest possible restraint in your sales pitches. This</p>

<p>is a highly subjective matter, and the group moderators will use their</p>

<p>best judgement in approving or rejecting posts that offer anything for</p>

<p>sale.</p>

<ul>
  <li>While announcements about political matters that directly affect the</li>
</ul>

<p>nonprofit sector in Massachusetts are sometimes appropriate, members</p>

<p>of the group are solidly opposed to political rants, calls to action</p>

<p>pertaining to partisan politics, fundraising pitches for political</p>

<p>campaigns, and extensive general discussions about politics. The group</p>

<p>moderators will use their best judgement in approving or rejecting</p>

<p>posts that pertain to political topics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Frame your message in the language of civil discourse, and avoid</li>
</ul>

<p>inflammatory rhetoric. Posts that are simply attacks on someone</p>

<p>else’s religion, operating system, ethics, ancestry, or attitude are</p>

<p>unacceptable in this email distribution list. The rule of thumb is to</p>

<p>assume that others are motivated by the best intentions, even when you</p>

<p>think that they are gravely mistaken.</p>

<p>Thanks for your attention to these guidelines. I’m sure that you will</p>

<p>find that following these suggestions is in the group’s best</p>

<p>interests.</p>

<p>Many thanks and best regards from Deborah</p>

<p>Deborah Elizabeth Finn</p>

<p>Mission-Based Massachusetts moderator</p>

<p><strong>In praise of a simple solution</strong></p>

<p>Dear MBM Colleagues,</p>

<p>Have you ever posted a message to the MBM list, but found that the</p>

<p>version being circulated looked odd, with all the lines running</p>

<p>together?</p>

<p>Garbled formatting is a leading cause of despair among readers of</p>

<p>email distribution lists, and using your “enter” key is something</p>

<p>positive that you can do to combat both the garbling and the despair.</p>

<p>Indeed, there’s an easy, simple solution to your formatting problem:</p>

<p>use the “enter” key twice to insert two blank lines when you come to</p>

<p>the end of a paragraph, or after you have typed in an item on a list.</p>

<p>This will put the proper amount of space between each paragraph (or</p>

<p>listed item) and what comes next. It will prevent everything from</p>

<p>running together, and make it more likely that other members of the</p>

<p>group will read your message.</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the “enter” key, you’ll find it on the</p>

<p>extreme right hand side of your keyboard,next to the quote mark (“)</p>

<p>and a row above the “shift” key.</p>

<p>I hope that this helps!</p>

<p>Best regards from Deborah</p>

    <p>A subchapter on art from K.C. Cole’s <em>Something incredibly wonderful happens: Frank Oppenheimer and the world he made up</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A Matter of Urgency</strong></p>

  <p><em>“It’s through familiarity with the arts that I think we will make the kinds of changes that make life stay human.”</em></p>

  <p>A respect for aesthetics, Frank thought, should be a central part of sound decision-making. He didn’t think it would be out of place — though he admitted it would be impractical — if Congress, unable to decide on a difﬁcult matter, took a recess to visit the National Gallery for guidance. “Art,” he liked to say, “is not valid merely to decorate our surroundings with statues in the plazas of skyscrapers, any more than science is valid because it provides the conveniences of electric shavers.”</p>

  <p>When people said, “We need more art,” Frank complained, they tended to say it in the same tone of voice they used to say, “We need more trees.” True, both art and trees make our surroundings more pleasant, but artists also make discoveries about nature and human nature that are on the same level as the discoveries scientists make. And in the same way that we can make better decisions about global warming if we know what scientists have discovered about the earth’s changing climate, so we can make better decisions about human affairs and environments if we pay better attention to what artists have learned.</p>

  <p>Frank worried a lot that the arts were undervalued, and that aesthetic considerations were largely ignored whether people were designing schools, supermarkets, bridges, or “topless dance joints, nuclear weapons, and homes for the aged.” If money was tight, aesthetics was the ﬁrst thing to go. “We’re in terrible trouble because of that,” he said. Historically, places that respected the arts and based decisions on aesthetics were also places where “better things happen,” he argued. If art were considered more important, he wrote to David Rockefeller, “many of the things that now shock or degrade people’s sensitivities would not be tolerated.”</p>

  <p>Of course, as a physicist Frank had learned to trust aesthetics. Scientists often try things because they “smell right.” They believe in theories because the mathematics behind them are “beautiful,” even when they contradict evidence. Like artists, scientists develop an eye (and ear) for nature, a sense of what is true and what is not. Laypeople, too, should be encouraged to rely on their aesthetic sense to guide their decisions, Frank thought; if a certain course of action or behavior struck them as “ugly,” then it probably was.</p>

  <p>Artists and scientists, Frank liked to say, are the ofﬁcial “noticers” of society — those who help us pay attention to things we’ve either never learned to see or have learned to ignore. Artists of all ages and in all lands have traditionally sensitized people to nature through their poetry and painting, sculpture and drama, and, less obviously, through their music. Without art, “one even ignores what people’s faces are like,” Frank said, “but by seeing paintings of people’s faces you begin to look at them again, and I think that the same thing is true of science. You look at the sky and you see the stars, and it is just an amorphous mass; but suddenly somebody talks to you about it and you see that some stars move with respect to other stars.”</p>

  <p>He gave artists credit for teaching us great human truths. Without art we might not have recognized the universality of the feeling between mother and child, he said, or the emotion between man and woman.</p>

  <p>“If you don’t know how to notice, you can’t do anything well,” Frank said. “You can’t even relate to people well.” You can’t tell if someone is angry or amused or hurt, or if the weather is about to change and maybe you should get an umbrella. You’ll miss that guy lurking in the shadows, and Saturn shining overhead.</p>

  <p>Frank wondered why urban planners didn’t look at paintings in order to learn how to design cities; why architects didn’t look at Cezannes to design cafés; why people didn’t look at portraits to ﬁnd meaning and wonder in the transformations that occur in aging faces and bodies. Why didn’t people realize that paintings enable us to ﬁnd pattern and structure in scenes that would otherwise seem shapeless, amorphous, and emotionless?</p>

  <p>So above all else, the Exploratorium was a place that encouraged the kind of everyday noticing that helped people develop an eye and ear and feel for the social and physical universe aroundthem — an almost artistic sensibility.</p>

  <p>Visitors to the Exploratorium certainly build up intuitive feelings for physical phenomena as much from artistic works as from “science” exhibits — whether the subject is wave mechanics or the nature of light or ﬂuid dynamics or the quantum properties of matter. To this day, when I imagine stars being born from swirling interstellar clouds, I think of Ned Kahn’s “Whirlpool”; when I think of exotic bits of matter coming into being seemingly out of nothing, I see his “Visible Effects of the Invisible.” Most of my intuitive feel for light and color and shadow and reﬂection comes from Bob Miller, and there is a lot of the spinning black hole in Doug Hollis’s “Vortex.”</p>

  <p>Even in terms of process, Frank pointed out, artists and scientists work in similar ways. They both start by noticing patterns in space and time, trying to make sense of them, rearranging them, and then linking patterns together in ways no one had thought to do before. They make sketches with equations or charcoal. They elaborate and synthesize. “They end up with a composition which means more than what they started with,” Frank wrote — melodies and theories. In essence, they make patterns of patterns that reveal new insights. Their compositions, theories, and other works separate relevancies from trivialities; provide a framework for memory; reassure by creating order out of confusion.</p>

  <p>Of course, all people spend much of their time perceiving and making sense of patterns; even animals do it (the dog knows exactly what follows the fetching of the leash). Frank once told me that when he can’t see a pattern, he gets “miserable.” But artists and scientists spend their whole lives looking for patterns in nature, and so perhaps learn to see more than the rest of us.</p>

  <p>To Frank, artists were people who looked at human experience in the same way astronomers looked at the sky through telescopes. Just as astronomers collect, codify, interpret, and communicate what is known about the stars, so artists collect, codify, interpret, and communicate what we know about human feelings.</p>

  <p>The reason we need this knowledge so much, he argued, is the rapid pace of change. If things didn’t change, then perhaps education could simply be a matter of learning to conduct business and follow directions. But everything in nature changes. People inevitably change the world in which they live. They change themselves. And as people(s) change, at some level there’s always a worry that we might lose some of that indeﬁnable and extraordinary specialness that makes people human. And who can define that essential nature of humanity we so want to preserve? Who can tell us (or remind us) what is ﬁne, what is beautiful, what is important, in humankind? Frank claimed that was the role of artists.</p>

  <p>Decisions about how to adapt to inevitable changes are based, by necessity, on what we believe is possible. Science tells us what is possible in the physical realm, and in doing so, gives us a basis for action. If we don’t know that it’s possible to make antibiotics, for example, we won’t learn how to protect ourselves against disease. In the same way, Frank thought, art tells us what is possible in human experience. What’s more, it tells us how we feel about the various possibilities or at least how an individual artist feels, and therefore one way it is possible to feel. “If you don’t know those things, you are not going to make good decisions,” he said.</p>

  <p>And just as technological inventions help us cope with changes in the external environment, we need “heightened social and emotional awareness and invention,” Frank said, to cope with changes in the human environment.</p>
