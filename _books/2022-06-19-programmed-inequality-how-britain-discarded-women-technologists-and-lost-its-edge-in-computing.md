The experience of learning about systemic racism in the US is a constant derailing of "but we can't know the actual intent"; systemic sexism on the otherhand is "oh, here are the receipts". Which is not to discount the research and scholarship of author Mar Hicks, more just to say "wow, there it is".

_Programmed Inequality_ is focused on one particular aspect covered by the more surveyish _Recoding Gender_. To attempt to summarize a lot:

- Take a systemic inequality, like the Marriage Bar, which made it unlawful for women to keep their job once they became married. 
- Then it's reasonable to imagine that managers will invest less time in training and developing women in the workplace.
- Then it's reasonable to imagine that women are less likely to be promoted into management and leadership.
- Then it's reasonable to imagine that women will be tracked into roles and functions that do not offer training or management potential.
- Then it's reasonable to imagine that roles and functions will be designed and shaped around these constraints and will develop bureacratic inertia.
- Then it's reasonable to imagine that other roles and functions (who happen to be men, because of the previous reasonable assertions) will be bureacratically competing for power and resources and prestige with those feminized roles and functions (and the women who fill them). And it will be ugly. 
- Then it's reasonable to imagine that, people being people, on human timescales with human constraints, and talent being equally distributed even when opportunity is not, they'll do their best to navigate and come to terms with it in different ways.  

It's a great book.
