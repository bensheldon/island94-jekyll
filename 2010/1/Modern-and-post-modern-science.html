    <p>A question from the <a href="http://www.librarything.com/topic/58098">Librarything discussion boards</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early Modern Science - 17th century - is fairly easy to label. But when did science become “modern”? And is there such a thing as “post-modern” science either to sociologists or scientists, or both? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Latour">Latour</a> has written a bit on this, I guess, but I’m not sure if many practising scientists would see themselves as practising constructivism rather than scientific objectivity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was my response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Breaking things into “modern” and “post-modern” is always difficult. If I were to break out the cusps of science, I would put them as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Formalized logic (the Greeks)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Formalized logic and scientific methodology rediscovered (15-17th century depending on how rigorous you want to be)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>scientific tools that augmented our senses (like the microscope): 17th century</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>application of “science” to human society itself (sociology, scientific management, eugenics): late 19th century</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>automated scientific tools (computers, DNA sequencers, etc.) and logic machines: mid-late 20th century</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If I were to pick a “modern” science moment, I would probably pick Carl Friedrich Gauss during the mid-late 18th century. More than anyone, I think Gauss really got the idea that he understood both the power and limits of science (he could be “critical” of science, which I think is the defining part of modernity): “There are problems to whose solution I would attach an infinitely greater importance than to those of mathematics, for example touching ethics, or our relation to God, or concerning our destiny and our future; but their solution lies wholly beyond us and completely outside the province of science.”</p>

  <p>As for post-modern science, I would place that somewhere in the mid-1950s (or maybe 1960s with the radical technology movement) with the realization that we now have the power to destroy ourselves (or reinvent ourselves with genetic alteration). I would add the development of environmental science, systems thinking (cybernetics) and the creation of logical machines to that, too. The defining piece of post-modernism is to integrate the critique into the process. This has seen positive social aspects: environmental science (especially ecosystem science) and systems thinking that seek to balance scientific knowledge with its technological application. And the negative: techno-utopianism that seeks to divorce information from biology (pushing people towards acting like rational machines rather than humans)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not perfectly happy with my response: instead of “criticism” as the defining part of modernity I should have written “self-criticism” (or “self-consciousness”).  Also, talking about <em>science</em> is always difficult since it’s not clear whether it’s the philosophy, the process, the practice, or the artifacts (technology) being referred to.</p>
