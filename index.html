  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently migrated <a href="https://dayoftheshirt.com">Day of the Shirt</a>, my graphic t-shirt sale aggregator, from storing image attachments with Carrierwave to Active Storage. It went ok! üëç</p>

<p>There were a couple of things driving this migration, though Carrierwave had served me very well for nearly a decade:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For budgetary reasons, I was moving the storage service from S3 to Digital Ocean Spaces. I knew I‚Äôd be doing some sort of data migration regardless.</li>
  <li>I was using some monkeypatches of Carrierwave v2 that weren‚Äôt compatible with Carrierwave v3. So I knew I‚Äôd have to dig into the internals anyways if I wanted to stay up to date.</li>
  <li>I generally trust Rails, and by extension Active Storage, to be reliable stewards when I take them on as a dependency.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I had a couple of requirements to work though, largely motivated because images in Day of the Shirt <em>are the content</em> with dozens or hundreds displayed on a single page:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For budget (slash performance), I need to link directly to image assets. No proxying or redirecting through the Rails app.</li>
  <li>For SEO, I need to customize the image filenames so they are relevant to the content.</li>
  <li>For performance (slash availability), I need to pre-process image transformations (convert, scale, crop) before they are published. Dozens of new designs can go up on the homepage at once.</li>
  <li>For availability, I need to validate that the images are (1) transformable and (2) actually transformed before they are published; invalid or missing images are unacceptable.</li>
</ul>

<p>How‚Äôd it go? Great! üéâ I am now fully switched over to Active Storage. It‚Äôs working really well and I was able to meet all of my requirements. Active Storage is very nice, as nice as Carrierwave.</p>

<p>But the errata? Yes, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing the blog post, and probably why you‚Äôre reading. To document all of the stuff I did that wasn‚Äôt in the <a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html">very excellent Active Storage Rails Guide.</a> Let‚Äôs go through it:</p>

<p><strong>Direct Linking to images</strong> is possible via the method described in this excellent post from Florin Lipan: <a href="https://lipanski.com/posts/activestorage-cdn-rails-direct-route">‚ÄúServing Active Storage uploads through a CDN with Rails direct routes‚Äù</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Customizing Active Storage filenames</strong> is possible with a monkeypatch (maybe <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/41004">someday it will be possible directly</a>). The patch simply adds the specified filename to the end of what otherwise would be a random string; and it seems durable through variants such that the variant extensions will be updated properly when the format is transformed (e.g. from a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.png</code> to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.jpg</code>):</p>

<p><strong>Preprocessing variants</strong> required tapping into some private methods to get the variant names back out of the system. Here‚Äôs an example of processing all of the variants when the attachment changes. Beware: attachments happen in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">after_commit</code>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/78HzHhMnhHY">which is good</a>, but means that I had to introduce a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">published</code> state to the record to ensure it was not visible until the variants were processed (there is a <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47473"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preprocessed:</code></a> option to process individual variants async in a background job but that, unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt meet my needs for synchronizing them all at once):</p>

<p><strong>Validating variants</strong> was easy with a very nice and well-named gem: <a href="https://github.com/igorkasyanchuk/active_storage_validations"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">active_storage_validations</code></a>. It <a href="https://github.com/igorkasyanchuk/active_storage_validations/blob/ab27760ecee7498e8fcb2a6434157c8cdd81038d/lib/active_storage_validations/metadata.rb#L122">works really well</a>.</p>

<p><strong>You will have N+1s</strong>, where you forget to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with_attached_*</code> scopes to some queries. Unfortunately Active Storage‚Äôs schema is laid out in a way that it will emit queries to the same model/table <em>even when it‚Äôs loading correctly</em>, so you may get <a href="https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet/issues/474">detection false positives</a> too. You can see that clearly in the next example with the doubly-nested <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blob</code> association.</p>

<p><strong>Active Storage‚Äôs schema is a beast</strong>. I get that it‚Äôs gone through a lot of changes, and Named Variants are an amazing hack when you see how they‚Äôve been implemented. And it‚Äôs wild. You can see that by how the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/9f178ada796a89c01f952fc05810b58b6f8682fc/activestorage/lib/active_storage/attached/model.rb#L129-L137">scope for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with_attached_*</code></a> is generated:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">includes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">_attachment"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">blob: </span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="ss">variant_records: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">image_attachment: :blob</span> <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="ss">preview_image_attachment: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">blob: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">variant_records: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">image_attachment: :blob</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I originally thought that when eager-loading through an association (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Merchant.includes(:shirts)</code>) I‚Äôd have to do something like this (ü´†):</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Merchant</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">includes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">shirts: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">blob: </span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="ss">variant_records: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">image_attachment: :blob</span> <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="ss">preview_image_attachment: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">blob: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">variant_records: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="ss">image_attachment: :blob</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>‚Ä¶but fortunately this seems to work too (üíÖ):</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">Merchant</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">includes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:shirts</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">merge</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Shirt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">with_attached_graphic</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That‚Äôs everything. All in all I‚Äôm very happy with the migration üåÖ</p>

    </p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I‚Äôve elevated to ‚Äústrongly held belief‚Äù that <a href="https://island94.org/2024/04/a-ruby-meetup-and-3-podcasts">code reloading and autoloading is <em>the</em> most important design constraint</a> when designing or architecting for Ruby on Rails.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code reloading is what powers the ‚Äúmake a code change, refresh the browser, see the result‚Äù development loop.</li>
  <li>Code autoloading is what allows Rails to boot in milliseconds (if you‚Äôve designed for it!) to run generators and application scripts and a single targeted test for tight test-driven-development loops.</li>
</ul>

<p>When <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/autoloading_and_reloading_constants.html">autoloading and reloading</a> just works, it probably isn‚Äôt something you think about. When code autoloading and reloading doesn‚Äôt work or works poorly, as it has on numerous apps across my career and consulting, it can be maddening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spending hours ‚Äúdebugging‚Äù some code only to realize that your changes were never being run at all.</li>
  <li>Waiting tens of excruciatingly boring seconds to run a simple test or watching the browser churn away while it slowly waits for a response from the development server.</li>
  <li>Feeling like you can write the code yourself each time faster than running a scaffold/template generator, repetitively over and over again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Code reloading and autoloading not working correctly is a huge pain. It‚Äôs not great, at all!</p>

<p>The history of code reloading and autoloading came up recently in the <a href="https://www.railsspeed.com">Rails Performance Slack</a>. A  developer working on an old Rails application asked what Spork was (a forking preloader), and whether it was necessary (not necessarily). As a Rails Developer who is increasingly aware of my <del>age</del> experience (I started working with Rails in 2012, long after it first launched in 2004, but it‚Äôs still been a minute), I realized I had something to share.</p>

<p>Over history, various strategies have been taken to make the development loop faster because that‚Äôs so important. Those strategies usually boil down to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Separating the (static) framework code from the (changing, developed) application code and only loading, just in time, what‚Äôs needed for the part of the application that‚Äôs currently running.</li>
  <li>Loading/booting the framework code that is unlikely to change, and then only (re-)load the application code when invoking a command or running a test.</li>
</ul>

<p>There have been various approaches to doing this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Forking Preloaders (Spork, though Spring is the more contemporary version): load up the framework code in a process once, then fork into a subprocess when you invoke a command and reload just the application code. Sometimes, things can get out of sync (some application code or state pollutes the primary process), and things get weird/confusing. This is why you‚Äôll hear of people hating on Spring or complaining, ‚ÄúI wasted all day on a development bug, and it turns out I just needed to restart Spring‚Äù (the analogous ‚Äúit was DNS all along‚Äù of the Rails world).</li>
  <li>Bootsnap, though operating on a cache strategy rather than a process-forker, serves a similar purpose of trying to speed up an application‚Äôs code loading time. The adoption of Bootsnap, and much, much faster CPUs in general, has largely replaced the usage of Spring in applications (though it‚Äôs still okay!).</li>
  <li>Zeitwerk autoloader also plays a role in this history because it, too, is trying to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù the necessity of separating the framework code (which changes infrequently) from the application code during development (which is actively being changed) to produce faster development feedback cycles. Zeitwerk replaced the previous autoloader built into Rails, whose lineage seems to date all the way back to <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/rails/commit/ee014ef95ae9746b4228f3bc7c85ac0df28ba1df">Rails 2.0 circa 2005</a>. Tell me the history / raison d‚Äô√™tre of the original autoloader if you know it!</li>
</ul>

<p>Look, a lot of labor has gone into this stuff. It‚Äôs important! And it‚Äôs easy to get wrong and produce a slow and disordered application where development is a pain. It happens! A lot!</p>

<p>I wish I could easily leave this post with some kind of <em>nugget</em> of something actionable to do, but it‚Äôs really more like: <strong>please take care</strong>. Some rules of thumb:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don‚Äôt reference, don‚Äôt access, don‚Äôt use or touch any constants in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/</code>, or allow them to be referenced (looking at you, custom Rack Middleware) unless you‚Äôre doing so from another constant in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/</code> (or somewhere that you <em>know</em> is <a href="https://island94.org/2023/05/whatever-you-do-don-t-autoload-rails-lib">autoloaded</a>).</li>
  <li>Take care with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config/initializers/</code> and ensure you‚Äôre making the most of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActiveSupport.on_load</code> hooks. Rails may even be missing <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html#available-load-hooks">some load hooks</a>, so make an upstream PR if you need to configure an autoloaded object and you can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs super common to run into trouble; in writing this blog post alone, I discovered a <a href="https://github.com/textacular/textacular/pull/159">problem with a gem I use</a>.</li>
  <li>If you‚Äôre writing library code, become familiar with the configuration-class-initializer-attribute-pattern dance (my name for it), which is how you‚Äôll get something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.action_view.something = :the_thing</code> lifted and constantized into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActionView::Base.something #=&gt; TheThing</code></li>

    <p>GoodJob version 4.0 has been released! üéâ GoodJob¬†v4 has breaking changes that should be addressed through a transitionary¬†v3.99¬†release, but if you‚Äôve kept up with v3.x releases and migrations, you‚Äôre likely ready to upgrade üöÄ</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job?tab=readme-ov-file#upgrading-v3-to-v4">README has an upgrade guide</a>. If you‚Äôd like to leave feedback about this release, please comment on the <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/discussions/1396">GitHub Discussions post üì£</a></p>

<p>If you‚Äôre not familiar with GoodJob, you can read the <a href="https://island94.org/2020/07/introducing-goodjob-1-0">introductory blog post</a> from four years ago. We‚Äôve come pretty far.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-changes-to-job-schema">Breaking changes to job schema</h3>

<p>GoodJob v4 changes how job and job execution records are stored in the database; moving from job and executions being commingled in the¬†<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good_jobs</code>¬†table to Jobs (still in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good_jobs</code>) having many discrete Execution records in¬†the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good_job_executions</code> table.</p>

<p>To safely upgrade, all unfinished jobs must use the new schema relationship, tracked in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good_jobs.is_discrete</code> column. This change was transparently introduced in GoodJob¬†<a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/releases/tag/v3.15.4">v3.15.4 (April 2023)</a>, so your application is likely ready-to-upgrade already if you have kept up with GoodJob updates and migrations. You can check by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v3.99</code>‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob.v4_ready?</code> in production or run the following SQL query on the production database and check it returns zero: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "good_jobs" WHERE finished_at IS NULL AND is_discrete IS NOT TRUE</code>. If not all unfinished jobs are stored in the new format, either wait to upgrade until those jobs finish or discard them. If you upgrade prematurely to v4 without allowing those jobs to finish, they may never be performed.</p>

<h3 id="other-notable-changes">Other notable changes</h3>

<p>GoodJob v4:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only supports Rails 6.1+, CRuby 3.0+ and JRuby 9.4+, Postgres 12+. Rails 6.0 is no longer supported. CRuby 2.6 and 2.7 are no longer supported. JRuby 9.3 is no longer supported.</li>
  <li>Changes job¬†priority¬†to give smaller numbers higher priority (default:¬†0), in accordance with Active Job‚Äôs definition of priority.</li>
  <li>Enqueues and executes jobs via the¬†<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob::Job</code>¬†model instead of¬†<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob::Execution</code></li>
  <li>Changes the behavior of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.good_job.cleanup_interval_jobs</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOOD_JOB_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_JOBS</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.good_job.cleanup_interval_seconds</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOOD_JOB_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS</code> set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚Äù </code> to no longer disable count- or time-based cleanups. Instead, now set to¬†<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>¬†to disable, or¬†<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1</code>¬†to run a cleanup after every job execution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>

<p>GoodJob v4 does not introduce any new features on its own. In the 110 releases since GoodJob v3.0 was released (June, 2022), these new features and improvements have been introduced:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job#batches">Batches</a></li>
  <li>Bulk enqueueing including support for Active Job‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perform_all_later</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job?tab=readme-ov-file#labelled-jobs">Labelled jobs</a></li>
  <li>Throttling added to <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job?tab=readme-ov-file#concurrency-controls">Concurrency Controls</a></li>
  <li>Improvements to the <a href="https://goodjob-demo.herokuapp.com/good_job/jobs">Web Dashboard</a>, including Dark Mode, performance dashboard, and improved UI,  and customizable templates.</li>
  <li>Storage of error backtraces. Improved handling of job error conditions, including signal interruptions. Added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob.current_thread_running?</code>¬†and¬†<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob.current_thread_shutting_down?</code> to support job iteration.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/pull/665">Ordered Queues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/pull/727"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">queue_select_limit</code></a> and further options for configuring queue order and performance.</li>
  <li>Improvements to Cron / Repeating Jobs.</li>
  <li>Operational improvements including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd</code> integration, improved health checks.</li>
</ul>

    <p><strong>Update: This has been mostly fixed upstream in Rails (Rails 8.0, I think) and <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52209">documented in the Rails Guides</a>.</strong></p>

<p><em>Huge thank you to Vojta Drbohlav in the <a href="https://www.railsspeed.com/">Rails Performance Slack</a> for helping me figure this out! üôá</em></p>

<p>Things I learned today about a new-to-me Ruby on Rails feature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rail 7.1 added a feature called <a href="https://blog.kiprosh.com/allow-template-to-set-strict-locals/">‚ÄúStrict Locals‚Äù</a> that uses a magic comment in ERB templates to declare required and optional local variables. It looks like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;%# locals: (shirts:, class: nil) %&gt;</code> which in this example means when rendering the partial, it must be provided a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shirts</code> parameter and optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class</code> parameter. Having ERB templates act more like callable functions with explicit signatures is a nice feature.</li>
  <li>When using Rails Strict Locals, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local_assigns</code> variable <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4bb73233413f30fd7217bd7f08af44963f5832b1/actionview/lib/action_view/template.rb#L439-L444"><em>is not defined</em></a>. You can‚Äôt use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local_assigns</code>. You‚Äôll see an error that looks like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActionView::Template::Error (undefined local variable or method 'local_assigns' for an instance of #&lt;Class:0x0000000130536cc8&gt;)</code>. <strong>This has been <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52209">fixed</a> üéâ though <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local_assigns</code> doesn‚Äôt expose default values.</strong></li>
  <li>This is a problem if your template has locals that are also Ruby reserved keywords like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code>, which can be accessed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local_assigns[:class]</code> <em>unless you start using Strict Locals</em>.
To access local variables named with reserved keywords in your ERB template when using Strict Locals, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binding.local_variable_get(:the_variable_name)</code>, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binding.local_variable_get(:class)</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binding.local_variable_get(:if)</code>. <strong>This is still necessary if you want to access reserved keywords <em>with defaults</em> because the defaults don‚Äôt show up in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local_assigns</code>.</strong></li>
</ul>

    <ul>
  <li>I finished reading the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/243623-the-poppy-war">Poppy Wars trilogy</a>. It got tiresome by the end. I liked <em>Babel</em> much more, and I‚Äôm probably reading <em>Yellowface</em> next. I also read <em>Exit Interview</em>, which was another thrilling entry to the canon of ‚Äúfantastically brilliant not-men who work in tech for whom it really should go better but unfortunately and predictably doesn‚Äôt‚Äù.</li>
  <li>We saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31520076/">‚ÄúFilm is dead. Long live film!‚Äù</a> at the Roxie. It was enjoyable, reminded me of my big-Cable-Access-TV-energy days, and also gave far too little screen time to hearing from the film collectors wives (yes, exactly) and children. I thought this was my first movie theater since Covid, but Angelina reminded me we saw the Barbie Movie in a theater.</li>
  <li>I played Animal Well until the credits roll, and then I read the spoilers and have been going for completionism. Though I don‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôll get there before fully losing interest.</li>
  <li>I joined the Program Committee for RubyConf in Chicago in November. We‚Äôre trying to get the Call for Papers/Speakers released this week. Should be a good one.</li>
  <li>I started working on the GoodJob major version 4 release. It‚Äôs simply doing all the breaking changes that were previously warned about. A deprecation-warning made is debt unpaid. It‚Äôs not so bad.</li>
  <li>With my friend Rob, I started volunteering on the backend of <a href="https://www.knockfordemocracy.org">Knock for Democracy</a>. I occasionally see people try to make a Tolstoy-inspired statement like ‚ÄúHealthy applications are all the same, but unhealthy ones are each unhealthy in their own way‚Äù. But that‚Äôs not true! All the apps that need some TLC have the exact same problems as all the others. Surprise me for once!</li>
  <li>At work I‚Äôm nearly, nearly done with performance feedback and promotion packets and calibrations and all that. It‚Äôs the stuff that I truly enjoy as a manager, and also is terrible because of everything that‚Äôs outside my control. I also got asked to draw up a Ruby sponsorship budget for the year, which is the most normal administrative thing I think I‚Äôve ever been asked in my (checks watch) 12 years of working in Bay Area tech.</li>
  <li>I think the days of mobile apps for Day of the Shirt are numbered. I haven‚Äôt updated them ever since Apple rejected an update for the olde ‚ÄúSection 4.2: Minimum Functionality‚Äù thing, after like 8 freaking years in the App Store already. I did the olde ‚Äútalk to someone on the phone at Apple who unhelpfully can‚Äôt tell me what would be <em>enough</em> functionality.‚Äù And so they‚Äôve just been sitting and recently I got an email from a user that it won‚Äôt install on their new Android phone. So that sucks. It was a pain (when I was doing it) to develop 3 separate versions of Day of the Shirt: web, iOS, and Android, so maybe this is a sign to probably just commit to the web.</li>
  <li>A triple <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/bolognese-meat-sauce-hazan">recipe of bolognese</a> is too much for my pot to handle.</li>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently left this comment on a Pragmatic Engineer review of Fred Brook‚Äôs <em>Mythical Man Month</em> in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-changed-in-50-years-of-computing-8d0">‚ÄúWhat Changed in 50 Years of Computing: Part 2‚Äù</a>. This was what I reacted to:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p><strong>Software design and ‚Äúthe second-system effect‚Äù</strong></p>

  <p>Brooks covers an interesting phenomenon in Chapter 5: ‚ÄúThe Second-System Effect.‚Äù He states that architects tend to design their first system well, but they over-engineer the second one, and carry this over-engineering habit on to future systems.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>‚ÄúThis second system is the most dangerous system a [person] ever designs. When [they] do this and [their] third and later ones, [their] prior experiences will confirm each other as to the general characteristics of such systems, and their differences will identify those parts of [their] experience that are particular and not generalizable.‚Äù</p>

    <p>The general tendency is to over-design the second system, using all the ideas and frills that were sidetracked on the first one.‚Äù</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I can see this observation making sense at a time when:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Designing a system took nearly a year</li>
    <li>System designs were not circulated, pre-internet</li>
    <li>Architects were separated from ‚Äúimplementers‚Äù</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Today, all these assumptions are wrong:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Designing systems takes weeks, not years</li>
    <li>System designs are commonly written down and critiqued by others. We cover more in the article, Engineering Planning with RFCs, Design Documents and ADRs</li>
    <li>‚ÄúHands-off architects‚Äù are increasingly rare at startups, scaleups, and Big Tech</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a result, engineers design more than one or two systems in a year and get more feedback, so this ‚Äúsecond-system effect‚Äù is likely nonexistent.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And this was my comment/reaction:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>I think the Second-System Effect is still very present.</p>

  <p>I would say it most frequently manifests as a result of not recognizing Gall‚Äôs Law: ‚Äúall complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked.‚Äù</p>

  <p>What trips people up is usually that they start from a place of ‚ÄúX feature is hard to achieve in the current system‚Äù and then they start designing/architecting <em>for</em> that feature and not recognizing all of the other table-stakes necessities and Chesterton Fences of the current system, which only are recognized and bolted on late in the implementation when it is more difficult and complicated.</p>

  <p>The phrase ‚Äú10 years of experience, or 1 year of experience 10 times‚Äù comes to mind when thinking of people who only have the experience of implementing a new system once and trivially, and do not have the experience of growing and supporting and maintaining a system they designed over a meaningful lifecycle.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Which also reminds me of a <a href="https://www.simplermachines.com/exploration-tidying-ecto/">recent callback</a> to a <a href="https://lethain.com/notes-on-tidy-first/">Will Larson review of Kent Beck‚Äôs <em>Tidy First</em></a> about growing software:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>I really enjoyed this book, and reading it I flipped between three predominant thoughts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I‚Äôve never seen a team that works this way‚Äìdo any teams work this way?</li>
    <li>Most of the ways I‚Äôve seen teams work fall into the ‚Äúnever tidy‚Äù camp, which is sort of an implicit belief that software can‚Äôt get much better except by replacing it entirely. Which is a bit depressing, if you really think about it</li>
    <li>Wouldn‚Äôt it be inspiring to live in a world where your team believes that software can actually improve without replacing it entirely?</li>
  </ul>

</blockquote>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Active Record, Ruby on Rail‚Äôs ORM, has support for Prepared Statements that work <em>if you structure your query for it</em>. Because of my work on GoodJob, which can make a lot of nearly identical database queries every second to pop its job queue, I‚Äôve invested a lot of time trying to make those queries as efficient as possible.</p>

<p>Prepared Statements are a database feature that allow the database to reuse query parsing and planning when queries are structurally the same. Prepared statements, at least in Postgres, are linked to the database connection/session and stored in memory in the database. This implies some things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There can be a <strong>performance benefit</strong> to making queries ‚Äúpreparable‚Äù for Prepared Statements which Active Record will decide for you based on how a query is structured.</li>
  <li>There can be a <strong>performance harm</strong> (or at least non-useful database processing and <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/14645">memory growth</a>) if your application produces a lot of preparable queries that are never reused again.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, Rails will have the database store 1,000 queries (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">statement_limit: 1000</code>). Many huge Rails monoliths (like GitHub, where I work) disable prepared statements (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepared_statements: false</code>) because there is too much query heterogeneity to get a performance benefit and the database spends extra and unnecessary cycles storing and evicting unused prepared statements.  But that‚Äôs maybe not your application!</p>

<p>Structurally similar queries can still have variable values inside of them: these are called <strong>bind parameters</strong>. For example, in GoodJob, I want pop jobs that are scheduled to run right now. In SQL that might look like:</p>

<p>That query has the downside of the timestamp changing multiple times a second as new queries are emitted. What I want to do is extract out the timestamp into a bind parameter (a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$1</code> depending on the database adapter) instead of embedded in the query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">good_jobs</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">scheduled_at</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="o">?</span>

<p>That very last option is the good one because it has the bind parameter (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$1</code>) and then the Active Record logger will show the values in the nested array next to the query. The successful combination uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arel comparable syntax</li>
  <li>Wrapping the value in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActiveRecord::Relation::QueryAttribute</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that many Active Record queries will automatically do this for you, but <em>not all of them</em>. In this particular case, it‚Äôs because I use the ‚Äúless than‚Äù operator, whereas equality does make it preparable. <strong>You‚Äôll have to inspect each query yourself.</strong> For example, it‚Äôs also necessary with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arel#matches</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ILIKE</code>. It‚Äôs also possible to temporarily disable prepared statements within a block in the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/6f0d1ad14b92b9f5906e44740fce8b4f1c7075dc/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb#L368-L373">undocumented</a> (!) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Model.connection.unprepared_statement { your_query }</code>.</p>

<p><strong>The above code is true as of Rails 7.1. <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51139">Jean Boussier has improved Active Record</a> in newer (currently unreleased) Rails to also properly bind <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Job.where("scheduled_at &lt; ?", Time.current)</code> query syntax too üôá</strong></p>

    <p>From Bunnie Hung‚Äôs blog about <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=7035">exploring and designing an infrared chip imaging rig</a>. I thought this is an interesting distinction between ‚Äúlow-effort‚Äù and ‚Äúrapid‚Äù prototypes. I think the analogy in software would be a <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WalkingSkeleton&quot;">‚ÄúWalking Skeleton</a> that is production-like in architecture and deployment but does very little, versus building a demo using lightweight scripting and static site generators. (bolded text mine)</p>

<blockquote>

  <p><strong>Sidebar: Iterate Through Low-Effort Prototypes (and not Rapid Prototypes)</strong></p>

  <p>With a rough idea of the problem I‚Äôm trying to solve, the next step is build some low-effort prototypes and learn why my ideas are flawed.</p>

  <p>I purposely call this ‚Äúlow-effort‚Äù instead of ‚Äúrapid‚Äù prototypes. ‚ÄúRapid prototyping‚Äù sets the expectation that we should invest in tooling so that we can think of an idea in the morning and have it on the lab bench by the afternoon, under the theory that faster iterations means faster progress.</p>

  <p>The problem with rapid prototyping is that it differs significantly from production processes. <strong>When you iterate using a tool that doesn‚Äôt mimic your production process, what you get is a solution that works in the lab, but is not suitable for production.</strong> This conclusion shouldn‚Äôt be too surprising ‚Äì evolutionary processes respond to all selective pressures in the environment, not just the abstract goals of a project. For example, parts optimized for 3D printing consider factors like scaffolding, but have no concern for undercuts and cavities that are impossible to produce with CNC processes. Meanwhile CNC parts will gravitate toward base dimensions that match bar stock, while minimizing the number of reference changes necessary during processing.</p>

  <p>So, I try to prototype using production processes ‚Äì but with low-effort. ‚ÄúLow-effort‚Äù means reducing the designer‚Äôs total cognitive load, even if it comes at the cost of a longer processing time. Low effort prototyping may require more patience, but also requires less attention. It turns out that prototyping-in-production is feasible, and is actually the standard practice in vibrant hardware ecosystems like Shenzhen. The main trade-off is that instead of having an idea that morning and a prototype on your desk by the afternoon, it might take a few days. And yes ‚Äì of course there ways to shave those few days down (already anticipating the comments informing me of this cool trick to speed things up) ‚Äì but <strong>the whole point is to not be distracted by the obsession of shortening cycle times, and spend more attention on the design. Increasing the time between generations by an order of magnitude might seem fatally slow for a convergent process, but the direction of convergence matters as much as the speed of convergence.</strong></p>

  <p>More importantly, if I were driving a PCB printer, CNC, or pick-and-place machine by myself, I‚Äôd be spending all morning getting that prototype on my desk. <strong>By ordering my prototypes from third party service providers, I can spend my time on something else. It also forces me to generate better documentation at each iteration, making it easier to retrace my footsteps when I mess up.</strong> Generally, I shoot for an iteration to take 2-4 weeks ‚Äì an eternity, I suppose, by Silicon Valley metrics ‚Äì but the two-week mark is nice because I can achieve it with almost no cognitive burden, and no expedite fees.</p>

  <p>I then spend at least several days to weeks characterizing the results of each iteration. It usually takes about 3-4 iterations for me to converge on a workable solution ‚Äì about a few months in total. I know, people are often shocked when I admit to them that I think it will take me some years to finish this project.</p>

  <p>A manager charged with optimizing innovation would point out that if I could cut the weeks out where I‚Äôm waiting to get the prototype back, I could improve the time constant on an exponential and therefore I‚Äôd be so much more productive: the compounding gains are so compelling that we should drop everything and invest heavily in rapid prototyping.</p>

  <p>However, this calculus misses the point that I should be spending a good chunk of time evaluating and improving each iteration. <strong>If I‚Äôm able to think of the next improvement within a few minutes of receiving the prototype, then I wasn‚Äôt imaginative enough in designing that iteration.</strong></p>

  <p>That‚Äôs the other failure of rapid prototyping: when there‚Äôs near zero cost to iterate, it doesn‚Äôt pay to put anything more than near zero effort into coming up with the next iteration. Rapid-prototyping iterations are faster, but in much smaller steps. In contrast, with low-effort prototyping, I feel less pressure to rush. My deliberative process is no longer the limiting factor for progress; I can ponder without stress, and take the time to document. This means I can make more progress every step, and so I need to take fewer steps.</p>

  <p>Farewell üëã Brompt is shutting down</p>

  <p>I have some sad news to share: I‚Äôm planning to shut down this service, Brompt, at the end of the month (February, 2024).</p>

  <p>Shutting down Brompt means that you‚Äôll no longer receive these automated reminders for your blog or writing. I‚Äôve been running Brompt since 2008 and unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt been able to make it sustainable. You‚Äôre one of about 80 people who are still using the service, though I‚Äôm never sure if you or anyone ever opens the emails regularly.</p>

  <p>Regardless of Brompt shutting down, I hope you‚Äôre doing well and I‚Äôd love to stay in touch. Send me an email at bensheldon@gmail.com or read my own blog at https://island94.org</p>

  <p>All the best,</p>
