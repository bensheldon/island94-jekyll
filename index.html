    <p>GoodJob version 4.0 has been released! 🎉 GoodJob v4 has breaking changes that should be addressed through a transitionary v3.99 release, but if you’ve kept up with v3.x releases and migrations, you’re likely ready to upgrade 🚀</p>

<p>If you’d like to leave feedback about this release, please comment on the <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/discussions/1396">GitHub Discussions post 📣</a></p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with GoodJob, you can read the <a href="https://island94.org/2020/07/introducing-goodjob-1-0">introductory blog post</a> from four years ago. We’ve come pretty far.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-changes-to-job-schema">Breaking changes to job schema</h3>

<p>GoodJob v4 changes how job and job execution records are stored in the database; moving from job and executions being commingled in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good_jobs</code> table to Jobs (still in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good_jobs</code>) having many discrete Execution records in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good_job_executions</code> table.</p>

<p>To safely upgrade, all unfinished jobs must use the new schema relationship, tracked in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good_jobs.is_discrete</code> column. This change was transparently introduced in GoodJob <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/releases/tag/v3.15.4">v3.15.4 (April 2023)</a>, so your application is likely ready-to-upgrade already if you have kept up with GoodJob updates and migrations. You can check by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v3.99</code>’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob.v4_ready?</code> in production or run the following SQL query on the production database and check it returns zero: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "good_jobs" WHERE finished_at IS NULL AND is_discrete IS NOT TRUE</code>. If not all unfinished jobs are stored in the new format, either wait to upgrade until those jobs finish or discard them. If you upgrade prematurely to v4 without allowing those jobs to finish, they may never be performed.</p>

<h3 id="other-notable-changes">Other notable changes</h3>

<p>GoodJob v4:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only supports Rails 6.1+, CRuby 3.0+ and JRuby 9.4+, Postgres 12+. Rails 6.0 is no longer supported. CRuby 2.6 and 2.7 are no longer supported. JRuby 9.3 is no longer supported.</li>
  <li>Changes job priority to give smaller numbers higher priority (default: 0), in accordance with Active Job’s definition of priority.</li>
  <li>Enqueues and executes jobs via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob::Job</code> model instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob::Execution</code></li>
  <li>Changes the behavior of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.good_job.cleanup_interval_jobs</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOOD_JOB_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_JOBS</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.good_job.cleanup_interval_seconds</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOOD_JOB_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS</code> set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">” </code> to no longer disable count- or time-based cleanups. Instead, now set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> to disable, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1</code> to run a cleanup after every job execution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>

<p>GoodJob v4 does not introduce any new features on its own. In the 110 releases since GoodJob v3.0 was released (June, 2022), these new features and improvements have been introduced:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job#batches">Batches</a></li>
  <li>Bulk enqueueing including support for Active Job’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perform_all_later</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job?tab=readme-ov-file#labelled-jobs">Labelled jobs</a></li>
  <li>Throttling added to <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job?tab=readme-ov-file#concurrency-controls">Concurrency Controls</a></li>
  <li>Improvements to the <a href="https://goodjob-demo.herokuapp.com/good_job/jobs">Web Dashboard</a>, including Dark Mode, performance dashboard, and improved UI,  and customizable templates.</li>
  <li>Storage of error backtraces. Improved handling of job error conditions, including signal interruptions. Added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob.current_thread_running?</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GoodJob.current_thread_shutting_down?</code> to support job iteration.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/pull/665">Ordered Queues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job/pull/727"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">queue_select_limit</code></a> and further options for configuring queue order and performance.</li>
  <li>Improvements to Cron / Repeating Jobs.</li>
  <li>Operational improvements including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd</code> integration, improved health checks.</li>
</ul>

    <p><em>Huge thank you to Vojta Drbohlav in the <a href="https://www.railsspeed.com/">Rails Performance Slack</a> for helping me figure this out! 🙇</em></p>

<p>Things I learned today about a new-to-me Ruby on Rails feature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rail 7.1 added a feature called <a href="https://blog.kiprosh.com/allow-template-to-set-strict-locals/">“Strict Locals”</a> that uses a magic comment in ERB templates to declare required and optional local variables. It looks like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;%# locals: (shirts:, class: nil) %&gt;</code> which in this example means when rendering the partial, it must be provided a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shirts</code> parameter and optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class</code> parameter. It’s a nice feature to have ERB templates act more like callable functions with explicit signatures.</li>
  <li>When using Rails Strict Locals, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local_assigns</code> variable <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4bb73233413f30fd7217bd7f08af44963f5832b1/actionview/lib/action_view/template.rb#L439-L444"><em>is not defined</em></a>. You can’t use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local_assigns</code>. You’ll see an error that looks like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActionView::Template::Error (undefined local variable or method 'local_assigns' for an instance of #&lt;Class:0x0000000130536cc8&gt;)</code>.</li>
  <li>This is a problem if your template has locals that are also Ruby reserved keywords like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code>, which can be accessed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local_assigns[:class]</code> <em>unless you start using Strict Locals</em>.</li>
  <li>To access those local variables named with reserved keywords in your ERB template when using Strict Locals, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binding.local_variable_get(:the_variable_name)</code> e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binding.local_variable_get(:class)</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binding.local_variable_get(:if)</code>.</li>
</ul>

    <ul>
  <li>I finished reading the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/243623-the-poppy-war">Poppy Wars trilogy</a>. It got tiresome by the end. I liked <em>Babel</em> much more, and I’m probably reading <em>Yellowface</em> next. I also read <em>Exit Interview</em>, which was another thrilling entry to the canon of “fantastically brilliant not-men who work in tech for whom it really should go better but unfortunately and predictably doesn’t”.</li>
  <li>We saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31520076/">“Film is dead. Long live film!”</a> at the Roxie. It was enjoyable, reminded me of my big-Cable-Access-TV-energy days, and also gave far too little screen time to hearing from the film collectors wives (yes, exactly) and children. I thought this was my first movie theater since Covid, but Angelina reminded me we saw the Barbie Movie in a theater.</li>
  <li>I played Animal Well until the credits roll, and then I read the spoilers and have been going for completionism. Though I don’t imagine I’ll get there before fully losing interest.</li>
  <li>I joined the Program Committee for RubyConf in Chicago in November. We’re trying to get the Call for Papers/Speakers released this week. Should be a good one.</li>
  <li>I started working on the GoodJob major version 4 release. It’s simply doing all the breaking changes that were previously warned about. A deprecation-warning made is debt unpaid. It’s not so bad.</li>
  <li>With my friend Rob, I started volunteering on the backend of <a href="https://www.knockfordemocracy.org">Knock for Democracy</a>. I occasionally see people try to make a Tolstoy-inspired statement like “Healthy applications are all the same, but unhealthy ones are each unhealthy in their own way”. But that’s not true! All the apps that need some TLC have the exact same problems as all the others. Surprise me for once!</li>
  <li>At work I’m nearly, nearly done with performance feedback and promotion packets and calibrations and all that. It’s the stuff that I truly enjoy as a manager, and also is terrible because of everything that’s outside my control. I also got asked to draw up a Ruby sponsorship budget for the year, which is the most normal administrative thing I think I’ve ever been asked in my (checks watch) 12 years of working in Bay Area tech.</li>
  <li>I think the days of mobile apps for Day of the Shirt are numbered. I haven’t updated them ever since Apple rejected an update for the olde “Section 4.2: Minimum Functionality” thing, after like 8 freaking years in the App Store already. I did the olde “talk to someone on the phone at Apple who unhelpfully can’t tell me what would be <em>enough</em> functionality.” And so they’ve just been sitting and recently I got an email from a user that it won’t install on their new Android phone. So that sucks. It was a pain (when I was doing it) to develop 3 separate versions of Day of the Shirt: web, iOS, and Android, so maybe this is a sign to probably just commit to the web.</li>
  <li>A triple <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/bolognese-meat-sauce-hazan">recipe of bolognese</a> is too much for my pot to handle.</li>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently left this comment on a Pragmatic Engineer review of Fred Brook’s <em>Mythical Man Month</em> in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-changed-in-50-years-of-computing-8d0">“What Changed in 50 Years of Computing: Part 2”</a>. This was what I reacted to:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p><strong>Software design and “the second-system effect”</strong></p>

  <p>Brooks covers an interesting phenomenon in Chapter 5: “The Second-System Effect.” He states that architects tend to design their first system well, but they over-engineer the second one, and carry this over-engineering habit on to future systems.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“This second system is the most dangerous system a [person] ever designs. When [they] do this and [their] third and later ones, [their] prior experiences will confirm each other as to the general characteristics of such systems, and their differences will identify those parts of [their] experience that are particular and not generalizable.”</p>

    <p>The general tendency is to over-design the second system, using all the ideas and frills that were sidetracked on the first one.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I can see this observation making sense at a time when:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Designing a system took nearly a year</li>
    <li>System designs were not circulated, pre-internet</li>
    <li>Architects were separated from “implementers”</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Today, all these assumptions are wrong:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Designing systems takes weeks, not years</li>
    <li>System designs are commonly written down and critiqued by others. We cover more in the article, Engineering Planning with RFCs, Design Documents and ADRs</li>
    <li>“Hands-off architects” are increasingly rare at startups, scaleups, and Big Tech</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a result, engineers design more than one or two systems in a year and get more feedback, so this “second-system effect” is likely nonexistent.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And this was my comment/reaction:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>I think the Second-System Effect is still very present.</p>

  <p>I would say it most frequently manifests as a result of not recognizing Gall’s Law: “all complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked.”</p>

  <p>What trips people up is usually that they start from a place of “X feature is hard to achieve in the current system” and then they start designing/architecting <em>for</em> that feature and not recognizing all of the other table-stakes necessities and Chesterton Fences of the current system, which only are recognized and bolted on late in the implementation when it is more difficult and complicated.</p>

  <p>The phrase “10 years of experience, or 1 year of experience 10 times” comes to mind when thinking of people who only have the experience of implementing a new system once and trivially, and do not have the experience of growing and supporting and maintaining a system they designed over a meaningful lifecycle.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Which also reminds me of a <a href="https://www.simplermachines.com/exploration-tidying-ecto/">recent callback</a> to a <a href="https://lethain.com/notes-on-tidy-first/">Will Larson review of Kent Beck’s <em>Tidy First</em></a> about growing software:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>I really enjoyed this book, and reading it I flipped between three predominant thoughts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I’ve never seen a team that works this way–do any teams work this way?</li>
    <li>Most of the ways I’ve seen teams work fall into the “never tidy” camp, which is sort of an implicit belief that software can’t get much better except by replacing it entirely. Which is a bit depressing, if you really think about it</li>
    <li>Wouldn’t it be inspiring to live in a world where your team believes that software can actually improve without replacing it entirely?</li>
  </ul>

</blockquote>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Active Record, Ruby on Rail’s ORM, has support for Prepared Statements that work <em>if you structure your query for it</em>. Because of my work on GoodJob, which can make a lot of nearly identical database queries every second to pop its job queue, I’ve invested a lot of time trying to make those queries as efficient as possible.</p>

<p>Prepared Statements are a database feature that allow the database to reuse query parsing and planning when queries are structurally the same. Prepared statements, at least in Postgres, are linked to the database connection/session and stored in memory in the database. This implies some things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There can be a <strong>performance benefit</strong> to making queries “preparable” for Prepared Statements which Active Record will decide for you based on how a query is structured.</li>
  <li>There can be a <strong>performance harm</strong> (or at least non-useful database processing and <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/14645">memory growth</a>) if your application produces a lot of preparable queries that are never reused again.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, Rails will have the database store 1,000 queries (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">statement_limit: 1000</code>). Many huge Rails monoliths (like GitHub, where I work) disable prepared statements (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepared_statements: false</code>) because there is too much query heterogeneity to get a performance benefit and the database spends extra and unnecessary cycles storing and evicting unused prepared statements.  But that’s maybe not your application!</p>

<p>Structurally similar queries can still have variable values inside of them: these are called <strong>bind parameters</strong>. For example, in GoodJob, I want pop jobs that are scheduled to run right now. In SQL that might look like:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">good_jobs</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">scheduled_at</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="s1">'2024-03-31 16:44:11.047499`
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>That query has the downside of the timestamp changing multiple times a second as new queries are emitted. What I want to do is extract out the timestamp into a bind parameter (a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$1</code> depending on the database adapter) instead of embedded in the query:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">good_jobs</span> <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">scheduled_at</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="o">?</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s the good stuff! That’s ideal and preparable 👍</p>

<p>But that’s raw SQL, now how to do that in Active Record? In the following exploration, I’m using the private <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">to_sql_and_binds</code> method in Active Record; I’m also using the private Arel API. This is all private and subject to change, so be sure to write some tests around this behavior if you do choose to use it.  Here’s some <a href="https://github.com/bensheldon/rails_tricks/blob/6c686c987ee9996bbad8a6ade1f92184c5a9ebf6/bind_params.rb">quick experiments</a> I’ve done:</p>

<p>That very last option is the good one because it has the bind parameter (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$1</code>) and then the Active Record logger will show the values in the nested array next to the query. The successful combination uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arel comparable syntax</li>
  <li>Wrapping the value in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActiveRecord::Relation::QueryAttribute</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that many Active Record queries will automatically do this for you, but <em>not all of them</em>. In this particular case, it’s because I use the “less than” operator, whereas equality does make it preparable. <strong>You’ll have to inspect each query yourself.</strong> For example, it’s also necessary with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arel#matches</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ILIKE</code>. It’s also possible to temporarily disable prepared statements within a block in the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/6f0d1ad14b92b9f5906e44740fce8b4f1c7075dc/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb#L368-L373">undocumented</a> (!) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Model.connection.unprepared_statement { your_query }</code>.</p>

<p><strong>The above code is true as of Rails 7.1. <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51139">Jean Boussier has improved Active Record</a> in newer (currently unreleased) Rails to also properly bind <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Job.where("scheduled_at &lt; ?", Time.current)</code> query syntax too 🙇</strong></p>

<p>Update: I realized I didn’t try beginless/endless range values. Good news: they create bind parameters 🎉</p>

    <p>From Bunnie Hung’s blog about <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=7035">exploring and designing an infrared chip imaging rig</a>. I thought this is an interesting distinction between “low-effort” and “rapid” prototypes. I think the analogy in software would be a <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WalkingSkeleton&quot;">“Walking Skeleton</a> that is production-like in architecture and deployment but does very little, versus building a demo using lightweight scripting and static site generators. (bolded text mine)</p>

<blockquote>

  <p><strong>Sidebar: Iterate Through Low-Effort Prototypes (and not Rapid Prototypes)</strong></p>

  <p>With a rough idea of the problem I’m trying to solve, the next step is build some low-effort prototypes and learn why my ideas are flawed.</p>

  <p>I purposely call this “low-effort” instead of “rapid” prototypes. “Rapid prototyping” sets the expectation that we should invest in tooling so that we can think of an idea in the morning and have it on the lab bench by the afternoon, under the theory that faster iterations means faster progress.</p>

  <p>The problem with rapid prototyping is that it differs significantly from production processes. <strong>When you iterate using a tool that doesn’t mimic your production process, what you get is a solution that works in the lab, but is not suitable for production.</strong> This conclusion shouldn’t be too surprising – evolutionary processes respond to all selective pressures in the environment, not just the abstract goals of a project. For example, parts optimized for 3D printing consider factors like scaffolding, but have no concern for undercuts and cavities that are impossible to produce with CNC processes. Meanwhile CNC parts will gravitate toward base dimensions that match bar stock, while minimizing the number of reference changes necessary during processing.</p>

  <p>So, I try to prototype using production processes – but with low-effort. “Low-effort” means reducing the designer’s total cognitive load, even if it comes at the cost of a longer processing time. Low effort prototyping may require more patience, but also requires less attention. It turns out that prototyping-in-production is feasible, and is actually the standard practice in vibrant hardware ecosystems like Shenzhen. The main trade-off is that instead of having an idea that morning and a prototype on your desk by the afternoon, it might take a few days. And yes – of course there ways to shave those few days down (already anticipating the comments informing me of this cool trick to speed things up) – but <strong>the whole point is to not be distracted by the obsession of shortening cycle times, and spend more attention on the design. Increasing the time between generations by an order of magnitude might seem fatally slow for a convergent process, but the direction of convergence matters as much as the speed of convergence.</strong></p>

  <p>More importantly, if I were driving a PCB printer, CNC, or pick-and-place machine by myself, I’d be spending all morning getting that prototype on my desk. <strong>By ordering my prototypes from third party service providers, I can spend my time on something else. It also forces me to generate better documentation at each iteration, making it easier to retrace my footsteps when I mess up.</strong> Generally, I shoot for an iteration to take 2-4 weeks – an eternity, I suppose, by Silicon Valley metrics – but the two-week mark is nice because I can achieve it with almost no cognitive burden, and no expedite fees.</p>

  <p>I then spend at least several days to weeks characterizing the results of each iteration. It usually takes about 3-4 iterations for me to converge on a workable solution – about a few months in total. I know, people are often shocked when I admit to them that I think it will take me some years to finish this project.</p>

  <p>A manager charged with optimizing innovation would point out that if I could cut the weeks out where I’m waiting to get the prototype back, I could improve the time constant on an exponential and therefore I’d be so much more productive: the compounding gains are so compelling that we should drop everything and invest heavily in rapid prototyping.</p>

  <p>However, this calculus misses the point that I should be spending a good chunk of time evaluating and improving each iteration. <strong>If I’m able to think of the next improvement within a few minutes of receiving the prototype, then I wasn’t imaginative enough in designing that iteration.</strong></p>

  <p>That’s the other failure of rapid prototyping: when there’s near zero cost to iterate, it doesn’t pay to put anything more than near zero effort into coming up with the next iteration. Rapid-prototyping iterations are faster, but in much smaller steps. In contrast, with low-effort prototyping, I feel less pressure to rush. My deliberative process is no longer the limiting factor for progress; I can ponder without stress, and take the time to document. This means I can make more progress every step, and so I need to take fewer steps.</p>

  <p>Farewell 👋 Brompt is shutting down</p>

  <p>I have some sad news to share: I’m planning to shut down this service, Brompt, at the end of the month (February, 2024).</p>

  <p>Shutting down Brompt means that you’ll no longer receive these automated reminders for your blog or writing. I’ve been running Brompt since 2008 and unfortunately, I haven’t been able to make it sustainable. You’re one of about 80 people who are still using the service, though I’m never sure if you or anyone ever opens the emails regularly.</p>

  <p>Regardless of Brompt shutting down, I hope you’re doing well and I’d love to stay in touch. Send me an email at bensheldon@gmail.com or read my own blog at https://island94.org</p>

  <p>All the best,</p>

    </p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I love the <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise user-authentication gem</a>. I’ve used it for years, and I recently moved off of it in one of my personal apps and replaced it with Rails’s built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_secure_password</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generates_secure_token</code> and a whole bunch of custom controllers and helpers and code that I now maintain myself. <strong>I do not recommend this! User authentication is hard! Security is hard!</strong></p>

<p><strong>And…</strong> maybe you need to walk the same path too. So I want to share what I learned through the process.</p>

<p>Ok, so to back up, why did I do this?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Greater compatibility with Rails <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>. My <a href="https://github.blog/2023-04-06-building-github-with-ruby-and-rails/">day job runs Rails <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code></a>, and I’m more frequently contributing to Rails development; I’d like to run my personal projects on Rails <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> too. When I looked back on upgrade-blocking gems, Devise (and its dependencies, like Responders) topped my list.</li>
  <li>More creative onboarding flows. I’ve twisted Devise quite a bit (it’s great!) to handle the different ways I want users to be able to register (elaborate onboarding flows, email-only subscriptions, optional passwords, magic logins). I’ve already customized or overloaded nearly every Devise controller and many model methods, so it didn’t seem like such a big change anyway.</li>
  <li>Hubris. I’ve built enterprise auth systems from scratch, managed the Bug Bounty program, and worked with security researchers. I have seen and caused and fixed some shit. (Fun fact: I have been paid for reporting auth vulnerabilities on the bug bounty platforms themselves.) I know that even if it’s not a bad idea <em>for me</em>, it’s not a great idea either. Go read <a href="https://github.com/advisories?query=devise+ecosystem%3Arubygems">all of the Devise-related CVEs</a>; seriously, it’s a responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>That last bit is why this blog post will not be like, “Here’s everything you need to know and do to ditch Devise.” Don’t do it! Instead, here’s some stuff I learned that I want to remember for the next app I work on.</p>

<h3 id="a-test-regime">A test regime</h3>

<p>I went back through all of my system tests for auth, and here is a cleaned-up, though not exhaustive list of my scenarios and assertions. It seems like a lot. It is! There are also unit tests for models and controllers and mailers and separate API tests for the iOS and Android apps. Don’t take this lightly! (Remember, many of these are specific to my custom onboarding flows).</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a new user signs up for an account
    <ul>
      <li>Their email is valid, present and stored; password is nil.</li>
      <li>They are not confirmed</li>
      <li>They receive a confirmation email</li>
      <li>If not confirmed, registering again with the same email resends the confirmation email but does not leak account presence</li>
      <li>If the email associated account already exists and is confirmed, sends a “you already have an account” email and does not leak account presence.</li>
      <li>Following the link in the confirmation email confirms the new account and redirects to the account setup page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When a user sets up their account
    <ul>
      <li>They can assign a username and password</li>
      <li>A password cannot be assigned if a password already exists</li>
      <li>A username cannot be assigned if a username already exists</li>
      <li>If a username and password already exist, the setup page redirects to the account update page</li>
      <li>The account update page redirects to the setup page if a username or password does not yet exist</li>
      <li>Signing in with an unsetup account redirects to setup page</li>
      <li>Resetting password with an unsetup account redirects to setup page</li>
      <li>Adding a password invalidates reset-password links.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When a user updates their account
    <ul>
      <li>The current password is required to update email, username, or password.</li>
      <li>When the email address is changed, a new confirmation email is sent out to that email address.</li>
      <li>An email change confirmation can be confirmed with or without an active session.</li>
      <li>If the email address is already confirmed by a different account, send the “you already have an account” email and do not leak account presence.</li>
      <li>Multiple accounts can have the same unconfirmed email address.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When a user performs a password reset
    <ul>
      <li>Can’t be accessed with an active session</li>
      <li>Link is invalidated after 20 minutes, or when email, or password changes.</li>
      <li>Can be performed on an unsetup account</li>
      <li>Confirms an email but not an email change</li>
      <li>Signs in the user</li>
      <li>Does not leak account presence</li>
      <li>Is throttled to only send once a minute.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When a user performs or resends an email confirmation
    <ul>
      <li>Can be accessed with an active session.</li>
      <li>Cannot resend confirmation of an email change without an active session.</li>
      <li>Link is invalidated after 20 minutes, or when email, unconfirmed email, confirmed at, or password changes.</li>
      <li>Signs in the user</li>
      <li>Does not leak account presence</li>
      <li>Is throttled to only send once a minute.</li>
      <li>When user is already confirmed, send them an email with a link to reset their password</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When a user signs into a session
    <ul>
      <li>Requires a valid email or username, and password</li>
      <li>Cannot sign in with a nil, blank, or absent password param (unsetup account)</li>
      <li>Session is invalidated when email or password changes.</li>
      <li>Does not leak account presence with missing or invalid credentials</li>
      <li>Redirects to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session[:return_to]</code> path if present, otherwise the root path.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="using-has_secure_password">Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_secure_password</code></h3>

<p>This was a fairly simple change. I had to explicitly add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bcrypt</code> to the gemfile, and then add to my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> model:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># models/user.rb</span>
<span class="n">alias_attribute</span> <span class="ss">:password_digest</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:encrypted_password</span>
<span class="n">has_secure_password</span> <span class="ss">:password</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ll eventually rename the database column, but this was a zero-migration change.</p>

<p>Also, you might need to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">validations: false</code>  on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_secure_password</code> and implement your own validations if you have custom onboarding flows like me. Read <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html">the docs</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/68eade83c87ae309191add6dfa4959d7d7e07464/activemodel/lib/active_model/secure_password.rb#L114">Rails code</a>.</p>

<p>When authenticating on sign in, you’ll want to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User.authenticate_by(email:, password:)</code>, which is intended to avoid timing attacks.</p>

<h3 id="using-generates_token_for">Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generates_token_for</code></h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generates_token_for</code> methods are new in Rails 7.1 and <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44189">really nice</a>. They create a signed token containing the user id and additional matching attributes and it doesn’t need to be stored in the database:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># models/user.rb</span>
<span class="n">generates_token_for</span> <span class="ss">:email_confirmation</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">expires_in: </span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">minutes</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">confirmed_at</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">unconfirmed_email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">password_salt</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">generates_token_for</span> <span class="ss">:password_reset</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">expires_in: </span><span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">minutes</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">password_salt</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ll explain that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">password_salt</code> in a bit.</p>

<p>To verify this, you want to do use something like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User.find_by_token_for(:email_confirmation, value_from_the_link)</code>.</p>

<p>btw security: when you put a link in an email message, you can only use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> , because emails can’t reliably submit web forms (some clients can, but it’s weird and unreliable). So your link is going to look like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://example.com/account/reset_password?token=blahblahblahblahblah</code>. If there is any links to 3rd party resources like script tags or off-domain images, you will <a href="https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00500400_cross-domain-referer-leakage">leak the token through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">referrer</code></a>  when the page is loaded with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?token=</code> in the URL. <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/pull/4366">Devise never fixed it (😱)</a> . What you should do is take value out of the query param and put it in the session and redirect back to the same page without the query parameter and use the session value instead. (Fun fact: this is a bug bounty that got me paid.)</p>
<h3 id="authenticatable-salts">Authenticatable salts</h3>

<p>Here’s where I explain that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">password_salt</code> value.</p>

<p>There’s several places I’ve mentioned where tokens and sessions should be invalidated when the account password changes. When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bcrypt</code> stores the password digest in the database, it also generates and includes a random “salt” value that changes every time the password changes. Comparing that salt is a proxy for “did the password change?” and it’s safer to embed that random salt in cookies and tokens instead of the user’s hashed password.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/e2242a95f3bb2e68ec0e9a064238ff7af6429545/lib/devise/models/database_authenticatable.rb#L15C6-L158C1">Devise uses the first 29 characters</a> of the encrypted password (which is technically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description">algorithm, cost and salt</a>):</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># models/user.rb</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">authenticatable_salt</span>
  <span class="n">encrypted_password</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">29</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">encrypted_password</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But it’s also possible to simply get the salt. I dunno if the difference matters (tell me!):</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># models/user.rb</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">password_salt</span>
  <span class="no">BCrypt</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Password</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">password_digest</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">salt</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">password_digest</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="a-nice-session">A nice session</h3>

<p>There’s a lot to write about creating sessions and remember-me cookies, that I won’t be writing here. The main thing to note is that I’m storing and verifying both the user id <em>and</em> their password salt in the session; that means all of their session are invalidated when they change their password:</p>

<p>In doing this project I learned that Rail’s cookies will magically serialize/deserialize arrays and hashes. I’ve been manually and laboriously converting them into JSON strings <em>for years</em> 🥵</p>

<p>btw, if that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNASSIGNED</code> stuff is new to you, go read my <a href="https://island94.org/2023/10/writing-object-shape-friendly-code-in-ruby">Writing Object Shape friendly code in Ruby</a>.</p>

<h3 id="rotating-active-sessions">Rotating active sessions</h3>

<p>This is a little <em>extra</em> but I wanted the switchover to be transparent to users. To do so, I read from Devise’s active sessions and then create a session cookie using the new format. It looks something like this:</p>

<p>Devise mixes some nice helper methods into Rails’s routing DSL like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authenticated</code>; they’re even <em>necessary</em> if you need to authenticate Rails Engines that can’t easily access the app’s ApplicationController methods. Here’s how to recreate them using <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#advanced-constraints">Route Constraints</a> and monkeypatching <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper</code> (that’s <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/blob/e2242a95f3bb2e68ec0e9a064238ff7af6429545/lib/devise/rails/routes.rb#L28">how Devise does it</a>)</p>

<p>Because routing happens <em>before</em> a controller is initialized, the current user is put into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request.env</code> so that the controller won’t have to query it a second time from the database. This could also be done in a custom Rack Middleware.</p>

<p>If you want to put stuff into not-the-session cookies, those cookies can be accessed via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request.cookie_jar,</code> e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request.cookie_jar.permanent.encrypted["_my_cookie"]</code>.</p>

<p>That was all the interesting bits for me. I also learned quite a bit poking around Dave Kimura’s <a href="https://github.com/kobaltz/action_auth">ActionAuth</a> (thank you!), and am thankful for the many years of service I’ve gotten from Devise.</p>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>One activity I don’t enjoy very much: griping about “technical debt”; that label just never seems descriptive enough. And the things people gripe about seem to mostly fall into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deferred maintenance: we haven’t updated to the latest version of X, or it’s written in A language/framework but now everyone is much more familiar with B, or we know M raises an exception at N when they O while P</li>
  <li>Just not the quality we expect, <a href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-267-debt-and-bridge-building">because <em>reasons</em></a>. It’s ok, we’re all winging it.</li>
</ul>

<p>…and those categories crowds out the real sweaty palms stuff, the “we did do a good job but we know more now” that I think is the real deal. I can talk about that.</p>

<p>I’ve never found the particular post/video/talk? again (I’ve looked!), but it described technical debt as like: the distance between the current understanding of the business domain and the technical implementation’s modeling of the business domain. It had a chart that has stuck in my mind; it looked something like this:</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/2024-01/technical-debt.png"><img src="/uploads/2024-01/technical-debt.png" alt="A chart that shows the coming together and divergence of business and technical domain knowledge" /></a></p>

<p>That definition of “technical debt” clicked for me. For myself and the high performing teams I’ve worked with, we’re most productive, pushing value, when we’re asking ourselves: does this make sense? Given what we know now, and what we know about where we’re going, do the objects and their interactions conceptually map to how the business is being talked about by the non-technical people? Are we adapting <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/engineering-principles-at-code-for-america/#:~:text=Optimize%20for%20speed%20of%20learning">at the same rate we’re learning</a>? If yes, we’re golden; if sorta with some tweaks that’s good; when no… that’s bad, disordered, schismatic: carrying a burden of always translating between the language and models in the technical system and the language and concepts in the business domain. That sucks!</p>

<p>Aside: There’s a funny/terrifying/random thing this makes me think of: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/an-oral-history-of-disney-the-emperors-new-groove.html">“We’ll Never Make That Kind of Movie Again”: An oral history of The Emperor’s New Groove, a raucous Disney animated film that almost never happened</a>. One of the screenwriters describes the process of making an animated film:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a normal four-year process, you’ve got meetings, you’ve got development people going, “What if the girl was a boy? What if the bird was a flower?” And then you have to run all those ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The software projects I’ve worked on are a conveyor belt of “What if the bird was a flower?” decision making and idea running. Extend that object, repurpose this method, bolt on that, change this, swap that, rename this, better leave a comment on that. When it’s going well, it doesn’t matter that it was a bird yesterday and a flower today… as long as it’s not retaining so much birdliness that it compromises its flowerability. It’s when you’re having to remember and callback “hey, well, um, it <em>was</em> once a bird, fyi, that’s why it’s so much trouble to do this flower stuff”, then you’re sunk.</p>

<p>It’s a bad sign when forward development requires telling stories about the past.</p>

<p>Here’s two stories…</p>

<h3 id="the-isolated-component">The isolated component</h3>

<p>When I was working at a website hosting startup, we had one component that I could just never get the support to integrate into the larger application. It was the form that would create a new website project for the user.  When the startup began, the original technical architecture was a bunch of interlinked but separated components: User Registration, User Account Management, Website Creation, Website Management, Organization Management, Agency/Reseller Management, etc. It made sense early as the business was figuring out what worked as a business, and then during my tenure we brought those components together into a unified application. Well, almost all of them.</p>

<p>There was a lot of give and take in the product integration; sometimes me and the other engineers would just <em>do it</em> and other times we’d defer it until there was a particular feature that necessitated it, and then we’d include that extra work in our estimates. It frequently took a <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bensheldon/real-world-dashboard">couple passes</a> of <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bensheldon/dashboard-performance-brownbag">code cleanup</a> and bringing it onto the design system, and that was ok. That’s the job!</p>

<p>That last, last, last component of Website Creation eluded us though, and it was outside our control. At that point, development was transitioning from “engineering led” to “product management and design led” and I had been instructed that engineering couldn’t make any product changes unless they were connected to an active PRD (Product Requirements Document) controlled by the PMs.</p>

<p>There was plenty of demand to make changes to Website Creation: smooth out the first-time account registration flow into creating a website; allow the user to do some activities in parallel while the website was spinning up like inviting team members or perusing billing levels; decouple the concept of “a website is a marketing strategy” from “upload your code and have some containers and a load balancer provisioned” so that non-developers could still <em>plan</em> a website without invoking all the technical bits.</p>

<p>But not enough appetite to get it done.</p>

<p>Of “technical debt”: everyone except our little engineering team maintaining the frontend didn’t think anything special of Website Creation. It wasn’t obvious unless you carefully watched for the hard-browser refresh, or noticed the navigation bar change slightly. Conceptually it was a unified product (heck, I even remember a product launch called “One”), but the work hadn’t yet been done on the application side and we engineers carried the burden.</p>

<p>It was funny because every time a product change that touched Website creation was discussed, the same thing happened:</p>

<p><strong>PM:</strong> Your effort estimate seems really high. What’s going on?
<br /><strong>Me:</strong> Well, this involves Website Creation and it’s still its own component and can’t access any of those other systems that are necessary to build the feature. We’d need to bring it into the rest of the application. It’s definitely possible! There’s a few open questions with product and design implications, so we’d need to work together on that.
<br /><strong>PM:</strong> Oh, well, huh, I didn’t expect that. Hmm, we don’t have the bandwidth for all that. Let’s pass on it for now.</p>

<p>This happened multiple times! It was weird too because the particular project being planned would be spiked, and then the engineering team would have to wait around while a new project was spun up and that likely took just as long as it would have taken to do the work on the Website Creation component. If I hadn’t been explicitly told to sit on my hands otherwise, I would have probably just done this as off-the-books, shucks-I-didn’t-think-it-would-be-a-big-deal, shadow-work.</p>

<p>It never got done during my tenure; I think they later decided the problem was that the whole thing wasn’t written in React 🤷</p>

<h3 id="the-campaign-message">The campaign message</h3>

<p>When I was a developer on GetCalFresh, the functionality with perpetually unexpected estimations was “Campaign Messages”.</p>

<p>GetCalFresh would help people apply for their initial food stamp application, at which point it would be sent to the applicant’s county for processing. Over the next 14 to 28 days the county would schedule an in-person or telephone interview, and request various documents like pay stubs and rental leases, and the applicant would have to navigate all of that. (The administrative state <a href="https://daveguarino.substack.com/p/state-snap-agencies-are-overloaded">suuuuucks</a>!) To help, GetCalFresh would send a sequence of email and/or SMS messages to the applicant over this time period explaining what was needed and what to expect next. A messaging campaign, y’know, of “campaign messages”</p>

<p>When GetCalFresh was first laid down in code, there were two “types” of campaign messages: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">General</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Expedited</code>. Under a couple of different circumstances, if an applicant is homeless or at risk of being homeless, or has no cash-on-hand to purchase food, their application is eligible for expedited processing and thus we’d send them a message sequence over ~14 days; everyone else would receive a message sequence over ~28 days. We were sending the same messages, just on a different schedule.</p>

<p>So when we engineers were then asked to customize a message, like “if the applicant is a student, add this description about their special eligibility”… we just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if/elsed</code> it on in there. Oh, now this county is piloting a special process, let’s make a little carve out for them too and swap this message. Still, same sequence, just tweaks, right? Well, all those small tweaks and carve-outs build up, and all of a sudden we’re having to ask “ok, so you want us to rewrite this one itty bitty message, well we also need you to specify what it should be for students, who do and don’t qualify for County X’s special process too”. It got twistier and twistier. And when requests like “don’t send that message in this special circumstance” or “add a totally new message but just as this one-off” came in, we’d be like “totally possible! and that’s gonna take more work than you think!”</p>

<p>GetCalFresh had the best Product Managers I have ever worked with in my life, and we still got locked into a similar loop as the last story: we’d do our estimation with the PMs, it exposed the fruit hung more high than low, and the change would be deprioritized. I think the PMs got it, but the challenge was that the other folks, client support and the folks coordinating with the counties and the datascience team, would be like “we heard that Engineering doesn’t want to build it.” So weird! Not engineering’s call! (Aside: I spent so much time coaching non-technical stakeholders on how to work in a PM-led system, but always more coaching to do.)</p>

<p>I remember making a Google Doc to analyze why and explain how the system we initially designed for (same sequence of messages with different schedules) didn’t match our understanding of the problem today. The doc listed out all of the different reasons we knew of why we might customize the message. It was at least 10 bullet points. And there were a lot of other learnings too: initially we designed around customizing for just 3 major county systems (State Automated Welfare Systems - SAWS), but later found ourselves doing county-by-county customizations (California has 52 counties). I advocated for configuring each county in its own object despite the <em>scale</em> brainworms demanding a singular and infinitely abstracted model (I call these things “spreadsheet problems” when you can simply list the entire domain in a spreadsheet).</p>

<p>Of “technical debt”, I still can replay in my brain the deliberate mental spatial shift of imagining the campaign model as a 2-column array (General and Expedited) with 10+ rows of logic shifts and then flopping it onto its side to make a change. All that mental context has a huge carrying cost that all of us had to budget for when making a change.</p>

<p>During my tenure, we never did the significant reworking to how campaign messages were implemented, though some bold colleagues did their best to make changes as safe and simple as possible with DSLs and test macros. Thank you! 🙏</p>

<h3 id="thats-it">That’s it</h3>

<p>Sorry, no great lessons here. Just stories to share (<a href="https://island94.org/2024/01/recently#:~:text=try%20to%20see%20it%20as%20a%20funny%20story">“ideally you’d try to see it as a funny story you can tell friends rather than a hurtful snub that needs to bother you”</a>) I mentioned coaching folks on working with PMs, and I think the frequent advice I gave non-technical folks probably holds true for engineers too when asking:</p>

<p><em>Always have your top 3 ranked work items ready to go when talking to decision makers (the PM?). Don’t bring new stuff unless it changes those top 3.</em></p>

<p>(I mean sure, share context and adapt, but allow yourself no doubt that you’ve’ clearly and consistently communicated what your top priorities are before they get dumped in with everyone else’s.)</p>

<p>(But also, if you’re an engineer and you can and no one is breathing down your neck, simply get it done and celebrate. The PM doesn’t have to lead everything. You can do it! 👍)</p>
